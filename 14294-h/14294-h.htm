<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE" />PREFACE</h2>

<p>The substance of the following volume was delivered in the form of
lectures in the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh during Session
1904-5. As "Alexander Robertson" lecturer in the University of Glasgow,
the writer dealt with the new religious ideas that have been impressing
themselves upon India during the British period of her history. As
"Gunning" lecturer in the University of Edinburgh, the writer dwelt more
upon the new social and political ideas. The popular belief of Hindu India
is, that there are no new ideas in India, that nought in India suffers
change, and that as things are, so they have always been. Even educated
Indians are reluctant to admit that things have changed and that their
community has had to submit to education and improvement&mdash;that
suttee, for example, was ever an honoured institution in the province now
most advanced. But to the observant student of the Indian people, the <i>
evolution</i> of India is almost as noteworthy as the more apparent
rigidity. There is a flowering plant common in Northern India, and chiefly
notable for the marvel of bearing flowers of different colours upon the
same root. The Hindus call it "the sport of Krishna"; Mahomedans, "the
flower of Abbas"; for the plant is now incorporate with both the great
religions of India, and even with their far-back beginnings. Yet it is a
comparatively recent importation into India; it is only the flower known
in Britain as "the marvel of Peru," and cannot have been introduced into
India more than three hundred years ago. It was then that the Portuguese
of India and the Spaniards of Peru were first in touch within the home
lands in Europe. In our own day may be seen the potato and the cauliflower
from Europe establishing themselves upon the dietary of Hindus in defiance
of the punctiliously orthodox. <i>&Agrave; fortiori</i>&mdash;strange that
we should reason thus from the trifling to the fundamental, yet not
strange to the Anglo-Indian and the Indian,&mdash;<i>&agrave;
fortiori</i>, we shall not be surprised to find novel and alien ideas
taking root in Indian soil.</p>

<p>Seeds, we are told, may be transported to a new soil, either wind-borne
or water-borne, carried in the stomachs of birds, or clinging by their
burs to the fur of animals. In the cocoa-nut, botanists point out, the
cocoa-nut palms possess a most serviceable ark wherein the seed may be
floated in safety over the sea to other shores. It is thus that the
cocoa-nut palm is one of the first of the larger plants to show themselves
upon a new coral reef or a bare volcano-born island. Into India itself, it
is declared, the cocoa-nut tree has thus come over-sea, nor is yet found
growing freely much farther than seventy miles from the shore. One of the
chief interests of the subject before us is that the seeds of the new
ideas in India during the past century are so clearly water-borne. They
are the outcome of British influence, direct or indirect.</p>

<p>Here are true test and evidence of the character of British influence
and effort, if we can distil from modern India some of the new ideas
prevailing, particularly in the new middle class. Where shall we find
evidence reliable of what British influence has been? Government Reports,
largely statistical, of "The Moral and Material Progress of India," are so
far serviceable, but only as <i>crude</i> material from which the answer
is to be distilled. Members of the Indian Civil Service, and others
belonging to the British Government of India, may volunteer as expert
witnesses regarding British influence, but they are interested parties;
they really stand with others at the bar. The testimony of the missionary
is not infrequently heard, less exactly informed, perhaps, than the Civil
Servant's, but more sympathetic, and affording better testimony where
personal acquaintance with the life of the people is needed. But of him
too, like the Civil Servant, there is some suspicion that in one sphere he
holds a brief. This, indeed, may be said in favour of the missionary's
testimony, that while the Anglo-Indian identifies the missionary's
standpoint with that of the native, the native identifies him with the
Anglo-Indian, so that probably enough he occupies the mean of impartiality
and truth. The British merchant in India may also offer as evidence, and
indeed is "on the spot," and apparently qualified by reason of his
independence. But the interest of his class is professedly limited to
India's material progress; and of his general views, we recall what
Chaucer said of the politics of his "merchant,"</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sowninge alway th' encrees of his
winning."</span><br />


<p>And finally, in increasing numbers, natives of India themselves are
claiming to pronounce upon the effect of the British connection upon
India; and yet again we feel that the proferred evidence must be regarded
with suspicion. That Indian is exceptional indeed whose generalisations
about India are based on observations and historical knowledge. If the
Civil Servant's honour is bound up with a favourable verdict upon the
question at issue, the educated native is as resolved upon the other side.
Nay, truth requires one to say that at this time the educated Indian is
virtually pledged against acknowledging any indebtedness to Britain. For
the reason why, we need not anticipate, but it is foolish to shut one's
eyes to the unpleasant fact, or to hide it from the British public.</p>

<p>Where, then, is the testimony that is reliable? Is there nothing else
than the disputing, loud and long, of the six blind men of Indostan who
went to <i>see</i> the Indian elephant and returned,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Each in his own opinion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exceeding stiff and strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though each was partly in the
right,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all were in the wrong!"</span><br />


<p>From preferred testimony of all kinds, from all affidavits, however
honestly sworn, we turn again to the ideas now prevailing as they <i>
betray</i> themselves in the lives of the people and the words that fall
from their lips. Carefully studying earlier history, we ask ourselves
wherein the new ideas differ from the ideas current in India a century
ago. Then as progress appears, or is absent, the forces at work stand
approved or condemned. The exact historical comparison we may claim to be
a special feature of this book.</p>

<p>The writer is not ignorant of the delicacy of the historical task he
has set himself. He claims that during the twenty years he spent in India
he was eager to know India and her sons, read the pamphlets and articles
they wrote, enjoyed constant intercourse with Indians of all classes and
religions, reckoned, as he still reckons, many Indians among his friends.
He claims that during these years it was his pleasure, as well as a part
of his professional duty, to study the past history of India. Ignorance of
Indian history vitiates much of the writing and oratory on Indian
subjects. As a member of the staff of an Indian college, with six hundred
University students, the writer claims to have had exceptional
opportunities of entering into the thoughts of the new middle class, and
of cross-questioning upon Indian problems. In India, students "sit at the
feet" of their professors, but let it not be assumed that the Oriental
phrase implies a stand-off superior and crouching inferior. Nay, rather it
implies the closest touch between teacher and taught. All seated
tailor-fashion on the ground, the Indian teacher of former days and his
disciples around him were literally as well as metaphorically in touch.
The modern professor, successor of the pandit or guru, enjoys intercourse
with his students, as full and free, limited in truth only by his time and
his temperament.</p>

<p>Judging by the test of the new ideas in India, the writer has no
hesitation in declaring that the British regime has been a great blessing
to India. Likewise, whether directly inculcated or indirectly, some of the
best features of Christian civilisation and of the Christian religion are
taking hold in India and becoming naturalised. Called upon as "Alexander
Robertson" lecturer in the University of Glasgow to deliver a course of
lectures "in defence of the Christian faith," the writer felt that no more
effective defence could be offered than this historical survey of the
naturalising in India of certain distinctive features of the Christian
religion and of the civilisation of western Christian lands.</p>

<p>Of this also the writer is sure, whether he possess the qualifications
for the delicate task or lack them&mdash;there is a call for some one to
interpret Britain and India to each other. In their helpless ignorance,
what wonder that Britons' views are often incomplete and distorted? On the
Indian side, on the other hand, the terrible anti-British feeling now
prevailing in India must surely be based on ignorance and
misunderstanding, and in part at least removable.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The Rev. Alexander Robertson, a probationer of the Free Church of
Scotland, although never in office, died at Glasgow in 1879, leaving the
residue of his estate for the endowment of a lectureship as aforesaid. As
trustees he nominated two personal friends&mdash;the Rev. J.B. Dalgety, of
the Abbey Church, Paisley, and James Lymburn, Esq., the librarian of
Glasgow University. These two gentlemen made over the trust to the Glasgow
University Court, and the writer had the honour of being appointed the
first lecturer.</p>

<p>The Gunning Victoria Jubilee Lectureship in the University of Edinburgh
was founded by the late Dr. R.H. Gunning of Edinburgh and Rio de Janeiro,
in the year 1889. The object of the lectureship was "to promote among
candidates for the ministry, and to bring out among ministers the fruits
of study in Science, Philosophy, Languages, Antiquity, and Sociology."</p>

<p>India is a land of manifold interest. For the visitors who crowd
thither every cold season, and for the still larger number who will never
see India, but have felt the glamour of the ancient land whose destiny is
now so strangely linked to that of our far-off and latter-day islands,
<!-- Page 2 --><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" />India has not one but many
interests. There is the interest of the architectural glories of the
Moghul emperors, in whose grand halls of audience, now deserted and merely
places of show, a solitary British soldier stands sentry over a visitors'
book. For the great capitals of India have moved from Delhi and Agra, the
old strategic points in the centre of the great northern plain, to
Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, and Rangoon, new cities on the sea, to suit the
later over-sea rulers of India. There is the interest of the grand
organisation of the British Government, holding in its strong paternal
grasp that vast continent of three hundred million souls. Sometimes the
sight of the letters V.R.I, or E.R.I. (Edwardus Rex Imperator) makes one
think of the imperial S.P.Q.R.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
"FNanchor_1_1" /><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> once not
unfamiliar in Britain. But this interest rather I would
emphasise&mdash;the penetration into the remotest jungle of the great
organisation of the British Government is a wonderful thing. By the
coinage, the post-office, the railways, the administration of justice, the
encouragement of education, the relief of famine,&mdash;by such ways the
great organisation has penetrated everywhere,&mdash;in spite
<!-- Page 3 --><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" />of faults, the greatest
blessing that has come to India in her long history. Travelling by rail
from Calcutta to Benares, the metropolis of Hinduism, situated upon the
north bank of the sacred Ganges, we see the British rule, in symbol, in
the great railway bridge spanning the river. By it old India,
self-centred, exclusive, introspective, was brought into the modern world;
compelled, one might say, by these great spans to admit the modern world
and its conveniences, in spite of protest that the railway bridge would
pollute the sacred stream. Crossing the bridge, our eyes are fixed on the
outstanding feature of Benares&mdash;city of hundreds of Hindu temples.
What is it? Not a Hindu temple, but a splendid Mahomedan mosque whose
minarets overlook the Hindu city, calling the city of Hindus to the
worship of Allah. For the site of that mosque, the Moghul emperor
Aurangzeb ruthlessly cleared away a magnificent temple most sacred to the
Hindus. Concerning another famous Hindu temple in the same city, listen to
the Autobiography of another earlier Moghul emperor, Jahangir. "It was the
belief of these people of hell [the Hindus] that a dead Hindu laid before
the idol would be restored to life, if in his life he had been a
worshipper there.... I employed a confidential <!-- Page 4 --><a name=
"Page_4" id="Page_4" />person to ascertain the truth, and as I justly
supposed, the whole was detected to be an impudent imposture.... Throwing
down the temple which was the scene of this imposture, with the very same
materials I erected on the spot the great mosque, because the very name of
Islam was proscribed at Benares, and with God's blessing it is my desire
... to fill it full of true believers." These things I write, not to hold
up to condemnation these Moghul rulers, but to point out by contrast the
voluntary character of the influence during the British and Christian
period. For there is in India a grander interest still than that of the
British political organisation, namely, the peaceful gradual
transformation of the thoughts and feelings, the hopes and fears, of each
individual of the millions of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nineteenth century in India&mdash;a conflict of
ideas</div>

<p>The real history of the past century in India has been the conflict and
commingling of ideas, a Homeric struggle, renewed in the nineteenth
century, between the gods of Asia and Europe. Sometimes the shock of
collision has been heard, as when by Act of Legislature, in 1829, Suttee
or widow-burning was put down, and, in 1891, the marriage of girls under
twelve; or when by order of the Executive, the sacred privacy of Indian
houses was violated in well-meant <!-- Page 5 --><a name="Page_5" id=
"Page_5" />endeavours to stay the plague [1895-], great riots ensuing; or
when an Indian of social standing has joined the Christian Church. At
other times, like the tumbling in, unnoticed, of slice upon slice of the
bank of a great Indian river flowing through an alluvial plain, opinion
has silently altered, and only later observers discover that the old idea
has changed. Not a hundred years ago, students of Kayasth (clerk) caste
were excluded from the Sanscrit College in Calcutta. Now, without any new
ordinance, they are admitted, as among the privileged castes, and the idea
of the brotherhood of man has thus made way. The silent invasion is
strikingly illustrated in the official <i>Report on Female Education in
India</i>, 1892 to 1897. On a map of India within the <i>Report</i>, the
places where female education was most advanced were coloured greener
according to the degree of advance&mdash;surely most inappropriate
colouring, though that is not our business. The map showed a strip of the
greenest green all round the sea-coast. There the unobserved new influence
came in. The <i>Census Report</i> for 1901 showed the same silently
obtruding influence from over the sea in the case of the education of
males. Many such silent changes might be noted. And <!-- Page 6 --><a
name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />yet again, the most diverse ideas may be
observed side by side in a strange chequer. In the closing years of the
nineteenth century, the University of Calcutta accepted an endowment of a
lectureship "to promote Sanscrit learning and Vedantic studies," any
Hindus without distinction of caste being eligible as lecturers; and then,
shortly after, agreed to the request of the first lecturer that none but
Hindus be admitted to the exposition of the sacred texts, thus excluding
the European heads of the university from a university lecture. Perhaps
the lecturer thought himself liberal, for to men like him at the beginning
of the century it would have been an offence to read the sacred texts with
Sudras or Hindus of humble castes. According to strict Hindu rule, only
brahmans can read the sacred books.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
"FNanchor_2_2" /><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian ideas.</div>

<p>For in all three spheres, social, political, and religious, the advent
of the new age implied more or less of a conflict. India has still of her
own a social system, political ideas, and religious ideas and ideals. In
the Indian social system, caste and the<!-- Page 7 --><a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7" /> social inferiority of women stand opposed to the freedom of
the individual and the equality of the sexes that prevail in Great
Britain, at least in greater degree. In the sphere of politics, the
absolutism, long familiar to the Indian mind, is the antithesis of the
life of a citizen under a limited monarchy, with party government and
unfettered political criticism. In the sphere of religion, the hereditary
priesthood of India stands over against the British ideal of a clergy
trained for their duties and proved in character. The Hindu conception of
a religious life as a life of sacrificial offerings and penances, or of
ecstasies, or of asceticism, or of sacred study, stands over against the
British ideal of religion in daily life and in practical philanthropies.
To the Hindu, the religious mood is that of ecstatic whole-hearted
devotion; the Briton reverences as the religious mood a quiet staying
intensity in noble endurance or effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Testimony to the change in ideas</div>

<p>The nineteenth century has witnessed a great transition in ideas and a
great alteration in the social and political and religious standpoints. It
is easy to find manifold witness to the fact from all parts of India. The
biographer of the modern in ideas. Indian reformer, Malabari, a Parsee<a
name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" /><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> writing of a <!-- Page 8 --><a name="Page_8" id=
"Page_8" />Parsee, and representing Western India, is impressed by the
singular fate that has destined the far-away British to affect India and
her ideals so profoundly. Crossing to the east side of India, we seek a
trustworthy witness. The well-known reformer, Keshub Chunder Sen, a
Bengali, and representative therefore of Eastern India, declares in a
lecture published in 1883: "Ever since the introduction of British power
into India there has been going on a constant upheaval and development of
the native mind,... whether we look at the mighty political changes which
have been wrought by that ... wonderful administrative machinery which the
British Government has set in motion, or whether we analyse those deep
national movements of <i>social</i> and <i>moral</i> reform which are
being carried on by native reformers and patriots." All Indian current
opinion is unanimous with the Parsee and the Bengali that a great movement
is in progress. The drift from the old moorings is a constant theme of
discourse. Let Sir Alfred Lyall, once head of the United Provinces, speak
for the most competent European <!-- Page 9 --><a name="Page_9" id=
"Page_9" />observers. "There may be grounds for anticipating," he says,
"that a solid universal peace and the impetus given by Europe must
together cause such rapid intellectual expansion that India will now be
carried swiftly through phases which have occupied long stages in the
lifetime of other nations."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" /><a
href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In another essay, in a more
positive mood, he writes of British responsibility for "great
non-Christian populations [in India] whose religious ideas and
institutions are being rapidly transformed by English law and morality."<a
name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" /><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> In a third passage he even prophesies rashly: "The end
of simple paganism is not far distant in India."</p>

<p>Sir George Bird wood has also had a long Indian career, and no one
suspects him of pro-British bias&mdash;rather the reverse. Yet we find him
writing to the <i>Times</i> in 1895 about one of the Indian provinces, as
follows: "The new Bengali language and literature," he says, "are the
direct products of our Law Courts, particularly the High Court at
Calcutta, of Mission schools and newspaper presses and Education
Departments, the agents which are everywhere, not in Bengal only, giving
if not absolute unity yet community in diversity <!-- Page 10 --><a name=
"Page_10" id="Page_10" />to the peoples of British India." The modern
literature of Bengal, he goes on to say, is Christian in its teaching; if
not the Christianity of creed and dogma, yet of the mind of Christ.</p>

<p>It is that transition in ideas, that alteration in social, political,
and religious standpoint which we are going to trace and illustrate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian conservatism.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Is mere inertia.</div>

<p>But while acknowledging the potent influences at work, and accepting
these representative utterances, it may yet be asked by the
incredulous&mdash;What of the inherent conservatism, the proverbial
tenacity of India? Is there really any perceptible and significant change
to record as the outcome of the influences of the nineteenth century?
Well, the expression "Indian conservatism" is misleading. There is no
Indian conservatism in the sense of a philosophy of politics, of society,
or of religion. Indian conservatism&mdash;what is it? To some extent an
idealising of the past, the golden age of great law-givers and
philosophers and saints. But very much more&mdash;mere inertia and
torpidity in mind and body, a reluctance to take stock of things, and an
instinctive treading in the <!-- Page 12 --><a name="Page_12" id=
"Page_12" />old paths. "Via trita, via tuta." In the path from one Indian
village to another may often be observed an inexplicable deviation from
the beeline, and then a return to the line again. It is where in some past
year some dead animal or some offensive thing has fallen in the path and
lain there. Year after year, long after the cause has disappeared, the
feet of the villagers continue in that same deviating track. That is in
perfect keeping with India. Or&mdash;to permit ourselves to follow up
another natural sequence&mdash;things may quickly begin to fit in with the
deviation. Perhaps the first rainy season after the feet of the villagers
had been made to step aside, some plant was found in possession of the
avoided spot. India-like, its right of possession was unconsciously
deferred to. And then the year following, may be, one or other of the
sacred fig trees appeared behind the plant, and in a few years starved it
out. Ten years will make a banyan sapling, or a pipal, into a sturdy
trunk, and lo, by that time, in some visitation of drought or cholera or
smallpox, or because some housewife was childless, coloured threads are
being tied upon the tree or some rude symbolic painting put upon it. Then
an ascetic comes along and seats himself in its shade, and now,
<!-- Page 13 --><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />already, a sacred
institution has been established that it would raise a riot to try to
remove.</p>

<p>Visitors to Allahabad go to see the great fort erected upon the bank of
the River Jumna by the Mahomedan emperor, Akbar. One of the sights of the
fort, strange to tell, is the underground Hindu temple of "The Undying
Banyan Tree," to which we descend by a long flight of steps. Such a sacred
banyan tree as we have imagined, Akbar found growing there upon the slope
of the river bank when he was requiring the ground for his fort. The
undying banyan tree is now a stump or log, but it or a predecessor was
visited by a Chinese pilgrim to Allahabad in the seventh century A.D.
Being very tolerant, instead of cutting down the tree, Akbar built a roof
over it and filled up the ground all round to the level he required. And
still through the gateway of the fort and down underground, the train of
pilgrims passes as of old to where the banyan tree is still declared to
grow. Such is Indian conservatism, undeterred by any thought of
incongruity. Benares is crowded with examples of the same unconscious
tenacity. I have spoken of the ruthless levelling of Hindu temples in
Benares in former days to make way for Mahomedan mosques.
<!-- Page 14 --><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />Near the gate of
Aurangzeb's mosque a strange scene meets the eye. Where the road leads to
the mosque, and with no Hindu temple nowadays in sight, are seated a
number of Hindu ashes-clad ascetics. What are they doing at the entrance
to a Mahomedan mosque? That is where their predecessors used to sit two
hundred years ago, before Aurangzeb tore down the holy Hindu temple of
Siva and erected the mosque in its stead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yields before a persistent obtruding
influence.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>E.g.</i> British influence.</div>

<p>But Indian conservatism is more than an indisposition to effort and
change; for the same reason, it is also an easy adaptation to things as
they are found. When a new disturbing influence obtrudes from without, and
persistently, it may be easier to give way than to resist. British
influence is such a persistent obtrusion. In English literature as taught
and read, in Christian standards of conduct, in the English language, and
in the modern ideas of government and society, ever presented to the
school-going section of the people of India within their own land, there
is such a continuous influence from without. The impression of works like
Tennyson's <i>In Memoriam</i> or <i>Idylls of the King</i>, common
text-books in colleges, the steady pressure of Acts of the British
Government in India, like that raising the marriage age<!-- Page 15 --><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15" /> of girls; the example of men in authority
like Lord Curzon, during whose vice-regal tour in South India there were
no nautch entertainments; the necessity of understanding expressions like
"general election" and "public spirit," and of comprehending in some
measure the working of local self-government&mdash;all such constant
pressure must effect a change in the mental standpoint. The army of
Britain in India, representative of the imperial sceptre, has now for many
years been gathered into cantonments, and its work is no longer to quell
hostilities within India, but only to repel invaders from without. Other
British forces, however, penetrating far deeper, working silently and for
the most part unobserved, are still in the field all over India, effecting
a grander change than the change of outward sovereignty. "Ideas rule the
world," and he who impresses his ideas is the real ruler of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian conservatism overpowered otherwise.</div>

<p>Telling against Indian conservatism or inertia are other things also
besides persistent Western influences. Many things Western appeal to the
natural desire for advancement and comfort, and the adoption of these has
often as corollary a change of idea. To take examples without further
explanation. The desire for education, the key to <!-- Page 16 --><a name=
"Page_16" id="Page_16" />advancement in life, has quietly ignored the old
orthodox idea that education in Sanscrit and the Sacred Scriptures, <i>
i.e.</i> higher education as formerly understood, is the exclusive
privilege of certain castes. The very expression "higher education" has
come to mean a modern English education, not as formerly an education in
Sanscrit lore. Had the British Government allowed things to take their
course, the still surviving institutions of the old kind for Oriental
learning would have been transformed, one and all, into modern schools and
colleges. Even in 1824, when Government, then under "Orientalist"
influence, founded the Sanscrit College in Calcutta for the encouragement
of Sanscrit learning, a numerous body of native gentlemen, with the famous
Raja Rammohan Roy at their head, petitioned that a college for the study
of Western learning might be established instead. For a number of years
now, the Sanscrit College, then founded, has actually had fewer pupils on
its rolls than it is permitted to admit at a greatly reduced fee.<a name=
"FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" /><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Again, the idea of <i>public questions</i>, the idea of the common
welfare, has come into being with the nineteenth century, and is quietly
repudiating caste and giving to the community a solidarity and a
<!-- Page 17 --><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" /> feeling of solidarity
unknown hitherto. Upon one platform now meet, as a matter of course, the
native gentlemen of all the castes, when any general grievance is felt or
any great occasion falls to be celebrated. The Western custom of public
meetings for the discussion of public questions is now an established
Indian institution, and daily gives the lie to the idea that there is
pollution in bodily contact with a person of lower caste. That a special
seat should be reserved for a man because he is a brahman would be
scouted. The convenience of travelling by rail or in tram-cars has been
even more widely effective in dissolving the idea. And if the advantage or
convenience of the new ways can overcome the force of custom, so can the
unprofitableness of the old. For illustrations, I pass from the gentlemen
who attend public meetings where the speeches are in English, to the less
educated and more superstitious and more blindly conservative people. In
the Mahratta districts of the Central Provinces, says the <i>Census
Report</i> for 1901, in recent years an unavoidable scepticism as to his
efficiency has tended to reduce the earnings of the Garpagari or averter
of hail from the crops. In Calcutta the same influence has extinguished
the trade of supplier of Ganges water. The water taps <!-- Page 18 --><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />in the house or on the street are too
convenient, and the quality of the water is too manifestly superior for
the desecration from the iron pipes to outweigh the advantages. A few
years ago, in Darjeeling, north of Bengal, the brahman names upon the
signs of the liquor shops were distinctly in the majority. The sacerdotal
caste, new style, had appreciated the chances of big profits and shut
their eyes to the regulations of caste, which have relegated drink-sellers
to a very low place in the scale. Brahmans are even said to figure among
the contractors who supply beef, flesh of the sacred animal, to the
British army in India. "A curious sign of the changing time," says Mr.
Lockwood Kipling (<i>Beast and Man in India</i>), "is the fact that Hindus
of good caste, seeing the profit that may be made from leather, are
quietly creeping into a business from which they are levitically barred.
Money prevails against caste more potently than missionary preaching."</p>

<p>In this region, where convenience or comfort or personal advancement
are concerned, it may safely be asserted that the so-called Indian
conservatism has not much resisting power. There, at least, it is found
that where there is a will there is a way.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
"FNanchor_7_7" /><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Indian mind awakened.</div>

<p><!-- Page 19 --><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />And there is a higher
influence at work dissolving and reconstituting the whole framework of
ideas. Upon the Indian mind, long lain fallow, modern civilisation and
modern thought and the fellowship with the world are acting as the
quickening rain and sunshine upon the fertile Indian soil. That these and
similar obtruding influences have had a transforming effect has already
been alleged. But far beyond, in promise at least, is the revived activity
of the Indian mind itself. If the age of Elizabeth be the outcome of the
stirring of the minds of Englishmen through the discovery of a new world,
the multiplication of books, the revival of learning, and the reformation
of religion, how shall we measure the effect upon the acute Indian mind of
the far more stimulating influences of this Indian Renaissance! What
comparison, for example, can be made between the stimulus of the new
learning of the sixteenth century and the stimulus of the first
introduction to a modern library? It would be an exaggeration to say that
the Indian mind is now showing all its power in response to the
<!-- Page 20 --><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />stimulus. But it is
everywhere active, and in some spheres, as in Religion and Philanthropy,
in History, in Arch&aelig;ology, in Law, in certain Natural Sciences,
individuals have already done service to India and contributed to
knowledge. Glimpses of great regions, unexplored, in these domains are
rousing students to secure for themselves a province. "More copies of
books of poetry, philosophy, law, and religion now issue every year from
the press of British India than during any century of native rule."<a
name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" /><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> Of course it would be misleading to ignore the fact
that reaction as well as progress has its apostles among the awakened
minds of India. Much of the awakened mental activity, also, is
spent&mdash;much wasted&mdash;on political writing and discussion, which
is often uninformed by knowledge of present facts and of Indian history.
The general poverty also, and the so-called Western desire to "get on,"
prevent many from becoming in any real sense students or thinkers or men
of public spirit.</p>

<p>Indian conservatism, therefore, we contend, is not the insurmountable
obstacle to new ideas that many superficially deem it to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caste represses individuality.</div>

<p>New ideas in the social sphere first claim our attention. The
individual and the community, each have rights, says a writer on the
philosophy of history, and it is hurtful when the balance is not
preserved. If the community be not securely established, the individuals
will have no opportunity to develop; if the individual be not free, the
community can have no real greatness. Speaking broadly, when Western
social ideas meet Indian, the conflict is between the rights of the
<!-- Page 22 --><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />individual as in Western
civilisation, and the rights of the community or society as in the Indian.
India stands for the statical <i>social</i> forces, modern Europe for the
dynamical and <i>individualistic</i>. In India, as in France before the
Revolution, certain established usages are prejudicially affecting the
progress of the individual, fettering him in many ways. I refer to caste,
the denial of the brotherhood of mankind, the artificial barricading of
class from class, the sacrifice of the individual to his
class&mdash;condemned by native reformers like Ramananda, Kabir, Nanak,
and Chaitanya long before the advent of European ideas. Whatever the
origin or original advantages of the caste system, it has long operated to
repress individuality.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" /><a href=
"#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is a vast boycotting agency
ready to hand to crush social non-conformity.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id=
"FNanchor_10_10" /><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> One
can easily understand that if society is rigidly organised for certain
social necessities (marriage for example) into a number of mutually
exclusive sets or circles, admission to all of which is by birth only, an
individual cast out from any set must <!-- Page 23 --><a name="Page_23"
id="Page_23" />perish. No one will eat with him, no one will intermarry
with him or his sons and daughters. It is into such a society that modern
social ideas have been sown, the ideas let us say of John Stuart Mill's
book, <i>On Liberty</i>&mdash;the <i>individual's</i> liberty, that is to
say&mdash;which used to be a common university text-book in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caste suggests an imperfect idea of the
community.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Nevertheless, a practical solidarity in
Hinduism.</div>

<p>Besides setting the community too much above the individual, the caste
system is faulty in presenting to the Indian mind an imperfect idea of the
community. The caste is the natural limit to one's interest and
consciousness of fellowship, to the exclusion of the larger community.
According to Raja Rammohan Roy, writing in 1824, the caste divisions are
"<i>as</i> destructive of national union as of social enjoyment." In <i>
Modern India</i>, Sir Monier Williams expresses himself similarly. Caste
"tends to split up the social fabric into numerous independent
communities, and to prevent all national and patriotic combinations." Too
much, however, may be made of this, for the practical solidarity of
Hinduism, in spite of caste divisions, is one of the most striking of
social phenomena in India. Whatever may have brought it about, the
solidarity of Hinduism is an undeniable fact. The supremacy of the
priestly caste <!-- Page 24 --><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" />over all
may have been a bond of union, <i>as</i> likewise the necessity of all
castes to employ the priests, for the Jewish ritual and the tribe of Levi
were the bonds of union among the twelve tribes of Israel. Sir Alfred
Lyall virtually defines Hinduism as <i>the employment of brahman
priests</i>, and it is the adoption of brahmans as celebrants in social
and religious ceremonies that marks the passing over of a non-Hindu
community into Hinduism. It is thus it becomes a new Hindu caste.<a name=
"FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" /><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a> Then, uniting further the mutually exclusive castes,
many are the common heritages, actual or adopted, of traditions and sacred
books, and the common national epics of the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.
The cause of the solidarity is not a common creed, as we shall see when we
reach the consideration of new religious ideas, ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New ideas opposed to caste, namely, individual
liberty and nationality.</div>

<p>If Hinduism as a social system is to be moved by the modern spirit, we
may look for movement in the direction of freedom of individual action,
that is, the loosening of caste; we may look for larger ideas of
nationality and citizenship, <!-- Page 25 --><a name="Page_25" id=
"Page_25" />superseding to some extent the idea of caste. As is not
infrequent in India, Government pointed out the way for public opinion. In
1831 the Governor-General, Lord William Bentinck, issued his fiat that no
native be debarred from office on account of caste, creed, or race, and
that a son who had left his father's religion did not thereby forfeit his
inheritance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loosening of caste.</div>

<p>To any observer it is now plain that while caste is still a very
powerful force, and even while new castes, new social rings, are being
formed through the working of the spirit of exclusiveness, the general
ideas of caste are undergoing change. In these latter days one can hardly
credit the account given of the consternation in Calcutta in 1775, when
the equality of men before the law was asserted, and the <i>brahman</i>,
Nanda-kumar, was hanged for forgery. Many of the orthodox brahmans shook
off the dust of the polluted city from their feet and quitted Calcutta for
a new residence across the Hooghly. In 1904, we find conservative Hindus
only writing to the newspapers to complain that even in the Hindu College
at Benares, the metropolis of Hinduism, some of the members of the College
Committee were openly violating the rules of<!-- Page 26 --><a name=
"Page_26" id="Page_26" /> caste. In the same year a Calcutta Hindu
newspaper, the <i>Amrita B&#257;z&#257;r Patrik&#257;</i>, declared,
"Caste is losing its hold on the Hindu mind."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
"FNanchor_12_12" /><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
recent denunciation of caste by an enlightened Hindu ruler, the Gaekwar of
Baroda, is a further significant sign of the times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Offences against caste.</div>

<p>What does caste forbid and punish? Freedom of thought, if not
translated into social act, has not been an offence against caste at any
time in the period under review, neither has caste taken cognisance of
sins against morality as such. The sins that caste has punished have been
chiefly five, as follows: Eating forbidden food, eating with persons of
lower caste, crossing the sea, desertion of Hinduism for another religion,
marrying with a person of a lower caste, and, in many communities also,
marrying a widow. The Hindustani proverb, "Eight brahmans, nine
cooking-places," hits off with a spice of <i>proverbial</i> exaggeration
the old punctiliousness about food. The sin of eating forbidden food is
thus described by Raja Rammohan Roy in 1816: "The chief part of the theory
and practice of Hinduism, I am sorry to say," writes the Raja, "is made to
consist in the <!-- Page 27 --><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />adoption
of a peculiar mode of diet; the least aberration from which (even though
the conduct of the offender may in other respects be pure and blameless)
is not only visited with the severest censure, but actually punished by
exclusion from the society of his family and friends. In a word, he is
doomed to undergo what is commonly called loss of caste."<a name=
"FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" /><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
"fnanchor">[13]</a> Now, in respect of the first three of these offences,
in all large centres of population the general attitude is rapidly
changing. In the light of modern ideas, these prohibitions of certain food
and of certain company at food, and of sea voyages, are fading like ghosts
at dawn. An actual incident of a few years ago reveals the prevailing
conflict of opinion, especially with regard to the serfdom which ties down
Indians to India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An actual case.</div>

<p>Two scions of a leading family in a certain provincial town of Bengal,
brave heretics, made a voyage to Britain and the Continent, and while away
from home, it was believed, flung caste restrictions to the winds. On
their return, the head of the family gave a feast to all of the caste in
the district, and no one objected to the presence of the two voyagers at
the feast. This <!-- Page 28 --><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />was
virtually their re-admission into caste. But shortly after, a document was
circulated among the caste complaining, without naming names, of the
readmission of such offenders. The tactics employed by the family of the
offenders are noteworthy. The demon of caste had raised his head, and they
dared not openly defy him. So the defence set up was the marvellous one
that, while on board ship and in Europe, the young men had never eaten any
forbidden or polluted food. They had lived upon fruit, it was said, which
no hand except their own had cut. The old caste sentiment was so strong
that the family of the voyagers felt compelled to bring an action for
libel against the publishers of the circular. They lost their case, as no
offender had been mentioned by name, and the tyranny of caste thus
indirectly received the support of the courts.</p>

<p>Of course it would still be easier to discover instances of the tyranny
of caste than the assertion of liberty, even among highly educated men. In
this matter of emancipation also, North India is far ahead of the South.
While minister at the court of Indore, 1872-75, the late Sir T. Madhava
Rao, a native of South India, was invited to go to England to give
evidence on Indian Finance <!-- Page 29 --><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29" />before a Committee of the House of Commons. <i>On religious
grounds</i> he was not able to accept the invitation.<a name=
"FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" /><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a> Nor is it generally known that the Bengali nobleman
who represented his country at the King's coronation in London belongs to
a family that is out of caste. If the newspapers are to be believed, an
orthodox Bengali Hindu was first invited to attend the coronation, and was
"unable to accept." Had that gentleman accepted and gone, his example
might at once have emancipated his countrymen. But he did not know his
hour. "There is a venial as well as a damning sin," we may note, in regard
to this crossing of the sea. "A man may cross the Indian Ocean to Africa
and still remain an orthodox Hindu. The sanctity of caste is not affected.
But let him go to Europe, and his caste as well as his creed is lost in
the sea."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" /><a href=
"#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> An orthodox Hindu has never
been seen in Britain.</p>

<p>It is worth noting also, that in earlier times it involved loss of
caste to go away South, even within India itself, among the Dravidean
peoples beyond the known Aryan pale in the North. Thus, slowly the cords
of serfdom lengthen.</p>

<p><!-- Page 30 --><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />Towards the fourth of
the offences against caste, namely, the adoption of a new religion, the
general attitude has likewise changed, although to a less degree. In large
towns, at least, the convert to Christianity is not so rigidly or so
instantaneously excluded from society as he used to be, and the Indian
Christian community, although small, is now in many places one of the
recognised sections of the community.</p>

<p>This certainly may be asserted, that the modern Hindus are being
familiarised as never before with non-brahman leaders, religious and
social. Neither of the recent Br&#257;hma (Theistic) leaders, the late
Keshub Chunder Sen and the late Protap Chunder Mozumdar, was brahman by
caste. The great Bombay reformer, the Parsee, Malabari, is not even a
Hindu. The founder of the Arya sect, the late Dyanand Saraswati, was out
of caste altogether, being the son of a brahman father and a low-caste
mother. The late Swami Vivekananda (Narendranath <i>Dutt</i>, B.A.), who
represented Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893,
was not a brahman, as his real surname plainly declares. While, most
wonderful of all, the accepted leaders of the pro-Hindu Theosophists,
champions of Hinduism more <!-- Page 31 --><a name="Page_31" id=
"Page_31" />Hindu than the Hindus, after whom the educated Hindus flock,
are not even Indians; alas, they belong, the most prominent of them, to
the inferior female sex! I mean the Russian lady, the late Madame
Blavatsky, the English ladies Mrs. Annie Besant and Miss Noble [Sister
Nivedita], and the American, Colonel Olcott. Which side of that glaring
incongruity is to give way&mdash;brahman and caste ideas, or the
buttressing of caste ideas by outcastes, Feringees, like Mrs. Besant? It
would be interesting to hear an orthodox brahman upon Mrs. Besant's claim
to have had a previous Hindu existence as a Sanscrit pandit. What sin did
the pandit commit, would be his natural reflection, that he was born again
a Feringee, and a woman?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unpardonable offences.</div>

<p>But the offence of the fifth sin, marrying below one's caste, or the
marriage of widows, seems as rank as ever. Upon these points, rather, the
force of caste seems concentrating. The marriage of widows will be
considered when we come to discuss the social inferiority of woman in
India. To marry within one's caste promises to be the most persistent of
all the caste ideas. The official observation is that "whatever may have
been the origin and the earlier developments of caste, this prohibition of
mixed marriages stands forth now as<!-- Page 32 --><a name="Page_32" id=
"Page_32" /> its essential and most prominent characteristic. The feeling
against such unions is deeply engrained." And again, a second
pronouncement on caste: "The regulations regarding food and drink are
comparatively fluid and transitory, while those relating to marriage are
remarkably stable and absolute."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
"FNanchor_16_16" /><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
pro-Hindu lady, already referred to, also agrees. "Of hereditary caste,"
she says, "the essential characteristic is the refusal of
intermarriage."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" /><a href=
"#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Even Indian Christians are
reluctant to marry below their old caste, and value a matrimonial alliance
with a higher. To that residuum of caste, when it becomes the residuum,
one could not object. The Aryan purity of the stock may be a fiction, as
authorities declare it to be in the great majority of castes and in by far
the greater part of India; but given the belief in the purity of blood,
the desire to preserve it is a natural desire. If one may prophesy, then,
regarding the fate of the caste system under the prevailing modern
influences, castes will survive longest simply as a number of in-marrying
social groups. To that hard core the caste idea is being visibly worn
down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Support of caste by British authorities.</div>

<p><!-- Page 33 --><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />With strange
obliviousness surely, the British officials are lending support to caste
ideas in various ways, while many of the best minds in India are groaning
under the tyranny. The compilers of the <i>Report of the Census of India
for</i> 1901, gentlemen to whom every student of India is deeply indebted,
in their enumeration of castes, give the imprimatur of government to such
Cimmerian notions as that the touch of certain low castes is defiling to
the higher. The writer and condoner of the following paragraph surely need
a lengthy furlough to Britain or the States. We read that "the table of
social precedence attached to the <i>Cochin Report</i> shows that while a
Nayar can pollute a man of a higher caste only by touching him, people of
the Kammalan group, including masons, blacksmiths, carpenters, and workers
in leather, pollute at a distance of 24 feet, toddy drawers at 36 feet,
Palayan or Cheruman cultivators at 48 feet; while in the case of the
Paraiyan (Pariahs) who eat beef, the range of pollution is stated to be no
less than 64 feet." Some consolation let us even here take from the fact
that in an earlier publication the extreme range of the polluting X-rays
of the pariah is stated to be 72 feet. So there has been 8 feet of
<!-- Page 34 --><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />progress for the pariah.
But our point is, that interesting as all that table of precedence no
doubt is, it is out of place in a Government report, which may be quoted
against a poor low-caste man as authoritative pronouncement regarding his
social position. Justice and humanity, good grounds in the eyes of the
Indian Government ere now for legislating contrary to caste ideas, ought
to have enjoined the ignoring of caste ideas here. It is no mere fancy
that after an accident one of these low-caste masons in South India might
be brought to the door of a Government hospital and be refused admission
by a native medical officer because his presence polluted at a distance of
24 feet&mdash;has not the Government Report declared it so? It is no
fancy, for a year or two ago the Post Office reported that in one village
the Post Office was found located where low castes were not allowed to
approach. In some provinces, also, teachers will object to the admission
of low-caste children in their schools; or "if they admit them make them
sit outside in the verandah."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id=
"FNanchor_18_18" /><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
What now of the dignity of manual labour which many a high official has
expounded to native youth? Or to take another instance of un-British
countenancing of the caste <!-- Page 35 --><a name="Page_35" id=
"Page_35" />idea. The Shahas of <i>Bengal</i> are a humble caste, and the
members of higher castes will not, as a rule, take water at their hands,
so the Government Report tells us. On the other hand, the Shahas of <i>
Assam</i>, immigrants from Bengal, have managed to raise themselves high
in the social scale. Why, when an Assam Shaha takes up his residence again
in his motherland, Bengal, should this Blue-book be casting up to him his
humble origin? Why this un-British weighting of those who are behind in
the race? Again, at the very time of the Census, the Maratha caste was in
conflict with the brahman in two Native States of Western India, Kohlapur
and Baroda, over a matter of religious privileges. The brahman contention
is that the Mahratta pretensions to high-caste blood [kshatriya] are
groundless, and now we have the very same statement in the <i>Census
Report</i>, backing "the king of the castle" against "the dirty rascal."
Not a century ago, students of kayasth [clerk] caste were excluded from
the Sanscrit College in Calcutta; they are now within the privileged
circle, but their claim might not yet have been made good had a Government
Blue-book of these earlier days been allowed to brand them as debarred
from the College by their caste. At a public meeting the writer heard one
of the <!-- Page 36 --><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />most learned and
respected Hindus of Calcutta respectfully protest to the
Lieutenant-Governor against the public recognition in the <i>Census
Report</i> of such irrational social grading.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
"FNanchor_19_19" /><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Similarly in the provision by Government of Caste Hostels for students.
According to the first rule of the Hindu Hostel in connection with the
Government College in Calcutta, "none but respectable Hindu students ...
shall be admitted,... and such inmates shall observe the rules and usages
of Hindu Society." In that rule, "respectable" simply means <i>other than
low caste</i>. Now for the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. A certain Bengali
gentleman of low caste was some years ago entitled to be addressed as
"Honourable," from the high public office he held, yet by departmental
orders the Principal of the Government College would shut the door of the
College Hostel in the face of the Honourable's son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New religious organisations repudiate caste.</div>

<p>Of the new religious organisations of educated India, three repudiate
caste, namely, the Protestant Christian community, the Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j or Theistic Association, chiefly found in Bengal, and the
&#256;rya Sam&#257;j or Vedic Association of the United Provinces and the
Punjab. These forces of new religious feeling are marshalled against
<!-- Page 37 --><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />caste as a social anomaly
and a bar to progress. Mahomedanism in its day was a powerful force
arrayed against caste, but its regenerating power has long ago evaporated,
for in many districts of India caste ideas are found flourishing among the
Mahomedan converts from Hinduism. They have carried over the caste ideas
from their old to their new religion.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id=
"FNanchor_20_20" /><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The
Sikhs in the Punjab also repudiate caste, but they too have forgotten
their old reforming mission. Notwithstanding, we repeat, Northern India
owes an immense debt to these two religions, particularly to Mahomedanism.
Let any one who doubts it observe the caste thraldom of Southern India,
where Mahomedan rule never established itself. Irrational as caste is in
Northern India, it is tenfold more so in the South, as we have already
seen. A noteworthy assertion of "the rights of men," or more literally of
the rights of women, against caste may be noted in that same caste-bound
South India. In the Native State of Travancore, caste custom had
prohibited the women of the lower castes from wearing clothing above the
waist. But about the year 1827, the women who became Christians began to
don a loose jacket as the women of higher caste had been in the habit of
doing. Bitter persecution of the <!-- Page 38 --><a name="Page_38" id=
"Page_38" />Christian women followed, but in 1859 the right of these
lower-caste women to wear an upper cloth was legally acknowledged.<a name=
"FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" /><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>But the outstanding evidence of new ideas in regard to caste is
furnished by the Hindu revivalists who, under the leading of Mrs. Annie
Besant and the Theosophists, have established the Hindu College, Benares,
as a buttress of Hinduism. From the <i>Text-book of Hindu Religion</i>
prepared for the College, we learn that these representatives and
champions of orthodoxy defend caste only to the extent of the ancient
fourfold division of society into brahmans, rulers, merchants and
agriculturists (one caste), and servants. What, we may ask, is to become
of the 1886 sub-divisions of the brahman caste alone, all mutually
exclusive with regard to inter-marriage? The text-book actually quotes
sacred texts to show that caste depends on conduct, not on birth, and
refers to bygone cases of promotion of heroes to a higher caste without
rebirth. Its final pronouncement on caste is that "unless the abuses that
are interwoven with it can be eliminated, its doom is certain." So far has
the opinion of orthodox conservative Hinduism progressed with reference to
its fundamental social feature, caste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English education the chief solvent.</div>

<p>English education is the chief solvent of old ideas in India and the
chief source from which the new are supplied. English is the language of
the freest peoples in the world. It is only to be expected, therefore,
that with the spread of English education in India the idea of individual
freedom and the feeling of nationality should grow and the caste idea
decline. The beginning of the process is often witnessed among the boys in
Secondary Schools in India. You lay your hand upon the arm of a boy, a
new-comer to the school, and you ask him in English, "What class?" He
answers "Brahman," giving you his caste instead of his class in school.
The boy will not be long <!-- Page 40 --><a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40" />in the English school before he will classify himself
differently. In a dozen ways each day he is made to feel that the school
and the modern world have another standard for boys and men than the
caste. Or take another example of the educative effect of a study of
English&mdash;I can vouch for its genuineness. In your house in India you
get into friendly conversation with a half-educated shopkeeper or native
tradesman. You ask in English how many children he has, and his reply is,
"I have not any children, I have three daughters." Just a little more
reading in English literature would have taught him that elsewhere the
daughter is a child of the family equally with the son.</p>

<p>There, in these two examples, the great social problems of India
present themselves&mdash;caste and the social inferiority of women, and in
the English language we see India confronted with ideas different from her
own. Take a third illustration from the socio-religious sphere. Few Hindus
think of Hinduism as a system of religious practices and doctrines to be
justified by reason or by spiritual intuition, or by the spiritual
satisfaction it can afford to mankind. No, Hinduism is a thing for
Indians, and belongs to the Indian soil. The <!-- Page 41 --><a name=
"Page_41" id="Page_41" />converse of the idea is that Christianity is a
foreign thing, the religion of the intruding ruling race. It is not for
Indians. A vigorous patriotic pamphlet, published in 1903, entitled <i>The
Future of India</i>, assumes plainly that <i>Hindus</i> and <i>Indians</i>
mean the same thing. The pamphlet speaks of the relations of Indians to
"other races, such as Mahomedans, Parsees, and Christians," as if these
were less truly Indians than the Hindus. To the writer, manifestly,
Hinduism is a racial thing. To him, however, or to the next generation
after him, further study of modern history will make clear that only in a
slight degree and a few instances is religion a racial thing, and that
there are laws and a science of spiritual as of bodily health. Once more,
how ill-fitting are, say, the Indian word <i>mukti</i> (deliverance from
further lives, the end of transmigrations) and the English word <i>
salvation</i>, although <i>mukti</i> and <i>salvation</i> are often
regarded as equivalents.</p>

<p>To the man instructed in English, such contrasts are always being
presented, tacitly inviting him to compare and to modify. We can put
ourselves in the place of many a youth of sixteen or seventeen, hope of
the village school, going up to enter a college in one of the larger towns
of India. He <!-- Page 42 --><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />is entering
the new world. Should he be of brahman caste, it may profit him a little,
for he will still meet with many non-brahman householders ready to find
him in food and lodging simply because he is a poor brahman student. Of
course he is looking forward to one of the new professions, Law, or
Medicine, or Engineering, or Teaching, or Government Service. In <i>
these</i> it is patent to him that caste is of no account. High caste or
low, he and all his fellow-students are aware they must prove themselves
and fight their way up. The leading place at the bar is no more a
high-caste man's privilege than it is his privilege to be exempted from
standing in the dock or suffering the extreme penalty of the law. We have
already referred to the effect of the assertion of the equality of men
before the law in 1775 in the hanging of the brahman, Nandakumar, for
forgery. Now, looking back at the dissolving of the old ideas of
artificial rank and privileges, we may reckon also the equality of men in
the great modern professions, foremost in India being Law, as among the
chief dissolving agencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extent of English education.</div>

<div class="sidenote">English words naturalised.</div>

<p>It is easy to give <i>figures</i> at least for the vast agency now at
work in the spread of English education in India. Higher English education
<!-- Page 43 --><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />for natives began with
the founding of the Hindu College in Calcutta in 1817; in the year 1902
there were in India five Universities, the examinations of which are
conducted in English; and affiliated to these examining Universities were
188 teaching colleges containing 23,009 undergraduates; and preparing for
the Matriculation Examination (in the year 1896-97) were 5267 Secondary
Schools, containing 535,155 pupils. From these Secondary Schools in the
year 1901, 21,750 candidates appeared at the Matriculation Examinations of
the Universities professing to be able to write their answers in English,
and of these nearly 8000 passed. That figure is a measure of the process
of leavening India with modern ideas through English education&mdash;8000
fresh recruits a year. That is the measure of the confusion introduced
into the old social organism. A small number, no doubt, compared with the
ten million of unleavened youth born in the same year, and yet they are
the pick of the middle classes and must become the leaders of the masses.
The <!-- Page 44 --><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" />masses in China, it
is alleged, would not be anti-foreign were it not for the influence of
their literati, and the thoughts of these Indian literati must also become
the thoughts of the Indian masses. It is the mind of these literati,
mainly, which we are trying to gauge. According to the census of 1901
their total number approached one million, being those who could read and
write English. Descending below the English-reading literati, I have noted
about three hundred English words naturalised in two of the chief
vernaculars of India, an indication, if not a measure, of the new
influence among the masses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Too sanguine prophecies of progress.</div>

<p>Yet having tabulated figures, once more, ere we proceed, we enjoin upon
ourselves and our readers a cautious estimate of the progress of ideas.
The European hood and gown of the Indian student may merely <i>drape</i>
an <i>unchanged</i> being. Writing in 1823 about the encouragement of
education and the teaching of English and the translation of English
books, the Governor of Bombay, Mountstuart Elphinstone, declared too
confidently that "the conversion of the natives <i>must</i> result from
the diffusion of knowledge among them." Macaulay, similarly, writing from
India in 1836 to his father, the well-known philanthropist, declares: "It
is my firm belief that if our plans of[English] education are followed up,
there will not be a single idolater among the respectable classes in
Bengal thirty years hence." Omar <!-- Page 45 --><a name="Page_45" id=
"Page_45" />Khayyam's words suggest themselves as the other extreme of
opinion regarding English education in India, inside of which the truth
will be found:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Myself when young did eagerly
frequent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doctor and saint, and heard great
argument</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">About it and about, but
evermore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came out by that same door wherein I
went."</span><br />


<p>The lines express the view of many Anglo-Indians. We may reply that
anywhere only a few individuals are positively liberalised by a liberal
education. We must patiently wait while their standpoint becomes the lore
and tradition of the community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reformers are English-speaking; reactionaries are
ignorant of English.</div>

<p>The part played by English education in the introduction of new ideas
is apparent whenever we enumerate the leading reformers of the nineteenth
century. One and all have received a modern English education, and several
of them have made some name by addresses and publications in English. Of
Indian reformers, distinguished also as English scholars, may be named
with all honour:</p>

<p>1. Rammohan Roy, a great opponent of Suttee and Idolatry, who also
dared to make the voyage to England. He died at Bristol in 1833.</p>

<p>2. Iswar Chunder Vidyasagar, a great upholder of the right of widows to
remarry and an advocate <!-- Page 46 --><a name="Page_46" id=
"Page_46" />of education, both elementary and higher. He died at Calcutta
in 1891.</p>

<p>3. K.M. Banerjea, D.L., C.I.E., an opponent of the caste system, the
greatest scholar among Indian Christians. He died at Calcutta in 1885.</p>

<p>4. Keshub Chunder Sen, religious reformer, an advocate of a higher
marriage age for girls. He died at Calcutta in 1884.</p>

<p>5. Mr. Behramji Malabari, an advocate of a higher marriage age for
girls&mdash;of the Bombay side of India.</p>

<p>6. The late Mr. Justice M.G. Ranade, a social reformer of Bombay.</p>

<p>7. The late Mr. Justice K.T. Telang, C.I.E., an opponent of child
marriages and a social reformer of Bombay.</p>

<p>8. The late Raja Sir T. Madhava Rao, K.C.S.I., a social reformer, of
the Madras Presidency&mdash;died in 1891.</p>

<p>Pandita Ramabhai, it may be noted, had entered upon her career as a
champion of female education before she began the study of English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sanguine estimate of progress.</div>

<p>In striking contrast with all these in this respect are the men who
represent the extreme conservative or reactionary spirit, who as a rule
are as ignorant of English as the great reformers are the reverse. We may
cite, in illustration:</p>

<p><!-- Page 47 --><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />1. Dyanand Saraswati,
founder of the new sect of &#256;ryas in the United Provinces and Punjab.
Their chief doctrine, the infallibility of the Vedas or earliest Hindu
scriptures, is reactionary, although a number of reforms are inculcated in
the name of a return to the Vedas.</p>

<p>2. The late Ramkrishna Paramhansa, a famous Bengali ascetic of high
spiritual tone, but of the old type.</p>

<p>3. The gentleman already referred to, who as University lecturer on
Hindu Philosophy in Calcutta insisted that none but Hindus be admitted to
the exposition of the sacred texts, shutting out the Chancellor, the
Vice-Chancellor, and many Fellows of the University.</p>

<p>4. Sanscrit pundits, very conservative as a class, and generally
unfamiliar with English.</p>

<p>New Hinduism in contact with the modern educational influences was most
interestingly manifest in the person of Swami Vivekananda (<i>Reverend
Rational-bliss</i> we may render his adopted name), representative of
Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. The
representative Hindu was not even a member of the priestly caste, as we
have already told. It were tedious to analyse his Hinduism, as set
<!-- Page 48 --><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />forth at Chicago and
elsewhere, into what was Christianity or modern thought, and what, on the
other hand, was Hinduism. Suffice it to say that as Narendra Nath Dutt,
B.A., he figures on the roll of graduates of the Church of Scotland's
College in Calcutta. While a student there, he sat at the feet of two
teachers representing the new and the old, the West and the East. In the
College classroom he received religious instruction from Dr. Hastie, the
distinguished theologian who afterwards taught Scottish students of
theology in the University of Glasgow. At the same time he was in the
habit of visiting the famous Bengali ascetic, Ramkrishna Paramhansa,
already mentioned, and of communing with him. Returning from Chicago
crowned with the honour which his earnestness, his eloquence, his power of
reasoning, his attractive manner, and his striking physique and dress
called forth, Young India lionised him; Old India met in Calcutta and
resolved that Mr. Dutt of kayasth caste must drop the brahman title <i>
Swami</i>, which he had assumed, before <i>they</i> could recognise him.
In 1895, having gone to Dakhineswar, the old residence of his Hindu
master, Ramkrishna, Swami Vivekananda was actually expelled from the
temple where his <!-- Page 49 --><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" />master
had been wont to worship. The Chicago representative of Hinduism had been
guilty of the sins of crossing the sea and of living like a European, and
so he must be disowned and the temple purged of his presence. After a few
years, Swami Vivekananda bravely settled down to unobtrusive,
philanthropic work, one had almost said <i>Christian philanthropic
work</i>, in a suburb of Calcutta, denouncing caste and idolatry and the
outcasting of those who had crossed the sea, and recommending the Hindus
to take to flesh-eating. There, and while so engaged, in 1902 he died. How
shall we ticket that strange personage? Kayasth caste as he was born, or
new brahman? Swami or B.A. of a Mission College of the modern Calcutta
University? A conservative or a reformer? Hindu ascetic or Christian
philanthropist? He stands for India in transition, old and new ideas
commingling. He is a typical product of the English and Christian
education given to multitudes in India to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social inferiority of women.</div>

<p>Next to caste, the chief social feature of India is the position of
women in the community. Hindus and Mahomedans alike assign to the female
sex an inferior position. In Mahomedan mosques, for example, no woman is
ever seen at prayer; she would not be permitted to take part. Only by the
neglect of female children in India, and the special disadvantages from
which women suffer there, can it be explained why in India in 1901 there
were only 963 females to every 1000 males. In India, as in Europe and all
the world over, more boys than girls are born, but in the course of life
the balance is soon redressed, and in the <!-- Page 51 --><a name=
"Page_51" id="Page_51" />whole population in every country in Europe,
except Italy<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22" /><a href=
"#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and Bulgaria, the females
actually outnumber the males. Why are the Indian figures so different?
Pro-Hindu enthusiasts may glorify the Hindu social system, and wish to
deny the social inferiority of the female sex; average Anglo-Indians may
be suspected of being unsympathetic in their statements; but the Census
figures stand, and demand an explanation. Where are these 37 girls and
women out of every 1000&mdash;over five million altogether? Common
humanity demands an answer of India, for we seem to hear a bitter cry of
India's womanhood. As infants, less cared for; as girls, less educated;
married too early; ignorantly tended in their hour; as married ladies,
shut out of the world; always more victimised by ignorance and
superstition&mdash;in life's race, India's women carry a heavy handicap,
and 37 out of every 1000 actually succumb.</p>

<p>In the matter of the social elevation of their sex, it appears to the
writer that Anglo-Indian ladies fall far short of what they might do. A
fair number do interest themselves in their Indian <!-- Page 52 --><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />sisters through the lady missionaries and
lady doctors, but first-hand knowledge of the lives of Indian women is
very rare indeed. Our late revered Queen's interest in India and in the
womanhood of India is well known, but her feeling about the duty of
Anglo-Indian ladies I have never seen recorded. Speaking at Balmoral to an
Indian Christian lady, a member of one of the royal families of
India&mdash;the only lady perhaps who ever conversed in Hindustani with
Queen Victoria&mdash;she expressed her regret that more Anglo-Indian
ladies did not get up the native language, sufficiently at least to let
them visit their Indian sisters. Than Christian sisterly sympathy thus
expressed, what better link also could there be between two communities
which many things seem to be forcing apart?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suttee and female infanticide.</div>

<p>It would be unjust to depreciate the influence of mother and wife among
Hindus, and we freely acknowledge that, after custom, the mainstay of the
zenana system is concern for the purity of the female members of the
household. Saying that, we must now also note that modern ideas of the
just rights of the female sex have made little progress in India. Some
progress there has been, judging by the standard already applied; for
<!-- Page 53 --><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />although in 1901 there
were only 963 females to every 1000 males, in the year 1891 there were
only 958, and in the year 1881 still fewer, namely, 954. But it seems as
if in India we had justification of the law of social progress that
woman's rights will not be recognised until man's have been. The
brotherhood of man must be established before men recognise that sister
women too have rights. Translating into Indian terms, and without
professing to have given positive proof&mdash;caste feeling must still
further decay before the position of women becomes much improved. At all
events, judging by the past, it almost seems to have been necessary for
the Legislature to intervene to secure any progress for the sex and give a
foothold to the new ideas, glaringly unfair to the sex as the old ideas
were. Thus in 1870 female infanticide, earlier prohibited in single
provinces, was put down by law throughout India; although there are
localities still in which the small proportion of female children
justifies the belief that female infanticide is not extinct.<a name=
"FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" /><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class=
"fnanchor">[23]</a> Nevertheless, let the progress of the new ideas
regarding women be noted; we compare the hesitating <i>inference</i> of
the practice of female infanticide in the <i>Indian Census
<!-- Page 54 --><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />Report</i> of 1901 with
the voluminous evidence in the two volumes of Parliamentary Papers on
Infanticide in India published in 1824 and 1828. Kathiawar and Cutch,
Baroda and Rajputana, round Benares and parts of Oude and Madras were the
localities particularly infected with the barbarous custom in the first
quarter of the century. But to return to the recognition of the rights of
women in legislative enactments. In 1829 an Act of the Supreme Government
in Bengal made Suttee or the burning of a widow upon the dead husband's
pyre an offence for all concerned. In 1830 similar Acts were passed by the
Governments of Madras and Bombay, and the abolition of Suttee is now
universally approved.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24" /><a
href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Such is the educative
influence of a good law. Perhaps a would-be patriot may yet occasionally
be heard so belauding the devotion of the widows who burned themselves
that his praise is tantamount to a lament over the abolition of Suttee.
But the general sentiment has been completely changed since the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, when the Missionaries and some
outstanding Indians like the Bengali reformer Rammohan <!-- Page 55 --><a
name="Page_55" id="Page_55" />Roy agitated for the abolition of Suttee,
and the Government, convinced, still hesitated to put down a custom so
generally approved. In these changed times it will hardly be believed that
Rammohan Roy only ventured to argue against any form of compulsion being
put upon the widow, and that the orthodox champions of the practice
appealed against the abolition not only to the Governor-General, but also
to the King in Council,&mdash;the petition having been heard in the House
of Lords in 1832. But once more to return to the emancipation of women by
Acts of the Legislature. By another Act, in 1856, the Indian Government
abolished the legal restrictions to widow marriage. Still another Act, in
1891, forbade cohabitation before the age of twelve; and although fiercely
opposed in the native press and in mass meetings, the Act, which expressed
the views of many educated Hindus, is now apparently acquiesced in by all,
and must be educating the community into a new idea of marriage.</p>

<p>In five aspects the social inferiority of the female sex is still
apparent&mdash;namely, in the illiteracy of females, in marriage before
womanhood, in polygamy, in the seclusion of women, and in the prohibition
of the marriage of widows. Excepting the last, no one of these customs is
<!-- Page 56 --><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />imposed by caste, nor is
the last even in every caste.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their lack of education.</div>

<p>The inferior position still assigned to women in Indian society can
best be shown in figures. The indifference to their education is manifest
when for all India, rich and poor, European and native, in 1901, there
were fourteen times as many men as women who could read and write. Only
one female in 144 was educated to that extent, and the movement for female
education has practically been at a stand-still for some years, in spite
of the increase of native Christians, Brahmas, and &#256;ryas, who all
advocate the education of girls, and in spite of fostering by Governments
and missionaries. Taking <i>British</i> India by itself, there was a
higher proportion of educated females, as we should of course expect,
although that only makes the proportion less elsewhere. In British India,
about 1 in 100 [9 per 1000] could read and write; but even there, less
than 1 per cent. The quickening of ideas in cities is apparent. In the
cities there are proportionally more than twice as many educated females
as in the whole country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Premature marriage.</div>

<p>The injustice done to the sex by marriage before womanhood is apparent
from another paragraph of the same Report, showing that out of every 1000
<!-- Page 57 --><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />girls of the age of 10 or
under, 58 are already married, as against 22 boys. Taking Hindus alone,
the number of married girls of 10 years of age or under is 70 per 1000 as
against 28 married boys. Even allowing for those provinces where
cohabitation is delayed, these figures mean in other provinces a cruel
wrong to the children of the weaker sex, a doubly cruel wrong when to
premature marriage may be added girl widowhood. The <i>Census Report</i>
declares that in the lower strata of Hindu society there has been a rapid
extension of child marriage and prohibition of the marriage of widows
within the last two or three generations, although at the low age of 10,
fewer girls are reported married than in 1881.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id=
"FNanchor_25_25" /><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
That is to say, the bad example of the higher castes is lowering the
marriage age in the humble castes, while modern influences are diminishing
the number of marriages of mere children,&mdash;we can see both forces in
operation. Here again Indian Christians, Br&#257;hmas, and &#256;ryas are
at one in setting a better example and advocating reform. The educative
Act of 1891 for British India has also been noted above. Native States too
are following up. In Rajputana, through the influence of the Agent of the
Governor-General, <!-- Page 58 --><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />Colonel
Walter, an association was formed in 1888 which fixed the marriage age for
two of the chief castes at eighteen for the bridegroom and fourteen for
the bride. In the Native State of Baroda, in the extreme West of India, a
new Marriage Act has just been passed by the enlightened ruler [1904]. In
Baroda, except in special cases, the minimum marriage age of girls is
henceforward to be twelve, and of the bridegrooms sixteen. Exceptional
cases had to be provided for, because of the custom in certain communities
within the state of Baroda to celebrate marriages only once every twelve
years, female infants and girls of ten and twelve being then "happily
despatched" together. With that custom and with the new Act together, it
would necessarily happen that girls of eleven at the general marrying time
would have to wait twelve years more, or until their twenty-third year.
Since in some parts of India there is a saying about women "Old at
twenty," that delay would not do. All educated young men may be said to
hold the new ideas in these marriage matters. Students now regard it with
regret and some sense of a grievance when their guardians have married
them in their school or college years. The only alleviation to their minds
is when the dowry which <!-- Page 59 --><a name="Page_59" id=
"Page_59" />they bring into the family at their marriage helps to endow a
sister who has reached the marriage age, or to educate a brother or pay
off the family debts. Among educated people too, the idea that the other
world is closed to bachelors and childless men has died, although a
daughter unmarried after the age of puberty is still a stigma on the
family. Do British readers realise that in an Indian novel of the middle
and upper classes there can hardly be a bride older than twelve; there can
be no love story of the long wooing and waiting of the lovers?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polygamy.</div>

<p>As regards polygamy, the Census shows 1011 married women for every 1000
married men, so that apparently not more than 11 married men in every 1000
are polygamists. But polygamy is still an Indian institution, in the sense
that it is at the option of any man to have more than one wife; in the
matter of marriage, the rights of man alone are regarded. All over India,
however, among the educated classes, Mahomedans excepted, public opinion
is now requiring a justification for a second marriage, as, for example,
the barrenness, insanity, infirmity, or misconduct of the first spouse.
The temptation of a second dowry is still, however, operative with men of
certain high castes in which <!-- Page 60 --><a name="Page_60" id=
"Page_60" />bridegrooms require to be paid for. The writer well remembers
the pitiful comic tale of a struggling brahman student of Bengal, whose
home had been made unhappy by the advent of two stepmothers in succession
alongside of his own mother. The young man did not blame his father, for
his father disapproved of polygamy, and was a polygamist only because he
could not help himself. It had come about in an evil hour when he was
desperate for a dowry for his eldest daughter, now come of marriageable
age. He had listened to the village money-lender's advice that he might
take a second wife himself and transfer to the daughter the dowry that the
second wife would bring. Then in like manner the lapse of time had brought
a second daughter to the marriage age, the necessity for another dowry,
and a third mother into the student's home. The poor fellow himself was
married too, and one could not resist the conjecture that <i>his</i>
marriage was another sacrifice for the family, and that his marriage had
saved his father from bringing home yet another stepmother. The redeeming
feature of the story&mdash;the strength of Indian family ties&mdash;let us
not be blind to.</p>

<p>Polygamy in India is certainly now hiding itself. A couple of
generations ago it was practised<!-- Page 61 --><a name="Page_61" id=
"Page_61" /> wholesale by the kulin brahmans of Bengal. Several
middle-aged kulins are known to have had more than 100 wives, and to have
spent their lives in a round of visits to their numerous fathers-in-law.
For each wife they had received a handsome bridegroom-price. So declares
the last <i>Census Report</i>. Except among Indian Mahomedans, who have
the sanction of the Koran and the example of the Prophet himself, there
are now few upholders of polygamy in India. In a meeting of educated
gentlemen in Calcutta a Mahomedan lately protested against some passing
condemnatory reference to polygamy, on the ground that in a general
meeting he expected that his religion would be free from attack. A learned
Mahomedan judge, on the other hand, writes that among Indian Mahomedans
"the feeling against polygamy is becoming a strong social if not a moral
conviction." "Ninety-five out of every 100 are either by conviction or
necessity monogamists." "It has become customary," he tells us, "to insert
in the marriage deed a clause by which the intending husband formally
renounces his supposed right to contract a second union."<a name=
"FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" /><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class=
"fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seclusion of women.</div>

<p>With regard to the seclusion of women, at some points the custom seems
to be slowly yielding to <!-- Page 62 --><a name="Page_62" id=
"Page_62" />Western ideas, although it is still practically true that
Indian ladies are never seen in society and in the streets of Indian
cities.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" /><a href=
"#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A different evolution,
however, is still more manifest at this present time. It almost seems as
if at first modern life were to bend to the custom of the seclusion of
women rather than bend the custom to itself. The Lady Dufferin Association
for Medical Aid to Indian Women is bringing trained medical women <i>
into</i> the zenanas and harems, and every year is also seeing a larger
number of Indian Christian and Br&#257;hma ladies set up as independent
practitioners, able to treat patients <i>within</i> the women's quarters.
In the year 1905 a lady lawyer, Miss Cornelia Sorabjee, a Parsee Christian
lady, was appointed by the Government of Bengal to be a legal adviser to
the Bengal Court of <i>Wards</i>, or landowning minors. Zenana or harem
ladies, e.g. the widowed mothers of the minors, would thus be able to
consult a trained lawyer at first hand <i>within</i> the zenana or harem.
Missionaries are discussing the propriety of authorising certain Christian
women to baptize women converts <i>within</i> the zenanas.<a name=
"FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" /><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class=
"fnanchor">[28]</a> Long ago missions organised <!-- Page 63 --><a name=
"Page_63" id="Page_63" />zenana schools, and now native associations have
begun to follow in their steps. In all Indian Christian churches, women of
course are present at public worship, but they always sit <i>apart</i>
from the men, a segregation even more strictly followed by the Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j or Indian Theistic Association. For the sake of zenana women,
the Indian Museum in Calcutta is closed one day each week to the male sex,
and in some native theatres there is a ladies gallery in which ladies may
see and not be seen behind a curtain of thin lawn. Movement even towards a
compromise, it is good to observe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prohibition of the marriage of widows.</div>

<p>The prohibition of the marriage of widows has already been referred to
as bound up with caste ideas of marriage and with social standing, and as
the most deeply rooted part of the social inferiority of women. By some at
least the injustice has been acknowledged since many years. At Calcutta,
between 1840 and 1850, Babu Mati Lal Seal promised Rs10,000 to any Hindu,
poor or rich, who would marry a widow of his own faith, but no one came
forward.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" /><a href=
"#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The late Pandit Iswar Chander
Vidyasagar of Calcutta has also already been mentioned as a champion of
the widow's rights. But though legalised in 1856, the cases
<!-- Page 64 --><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />of re-marriage among the
higher castes of Hindus in any year can still be counted on the fingers of
one hand. The <i>Report of the Census of India</i>, 1901, takes a gloomy
view regarding the province of Bengal, the most forward in many respects,
but the most backward in respect of child-marriage and prohibition of the
marriage of widows. The latter custom, we are told, "shows signs of
extending itself far beyond its present limits, and finally of suppressing
widow marriage throughout the entire Hindu community of Bengal."<a name=
"FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" /><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class=
"fnanchor">[30]</a> The actual number of widows in all India in 1901 was
25,891,936, or about 2 out of every 11 of the female population, more than
twice the proportion [1 in 13] in Great Britain. As in the matters of the
repudiation of caste and the raising of the marriage age, the three new
religious bodies, namely, the Indian Christians, the Brahmas, and the
&#256;ryas, stand side by side for the right of the widow.</p>

<br />


<div class="sidenote">No <i>Indian</i> race or religion.</div>

<p>Experience teaches the necessity of explaining to Western readers
certain terms which even long residence in India often fails to make clear
to Anglo-Indians. Let it be remembered then that the terms <i>India,
Indian</i>, have only a geographical reference: they do not signify any
particular race or religion. India is the great triangular continent
bounded on the south-west and south-east by the sea, and shut in on the
north by the Himalayan Mountains. Self-contained though it be, and easily
thought of as a geographical unit, we must not think of India as a racial,
linguistic, or religious unit. We may much more correctly speak of <i>
the</i> European race, language, or religion, than of <i>the</i> Indian.
<!-- Page 66 --><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" /></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Hindu religion.</div>

<p>The term <i>Hindu</i> refers to one of the Indian religions, the
religion of the great majority no doubt. It is not now a national or
geographical term. Practically every Hindu is an Indian, and almost
necessarily must be so, but every Indian is not a Hindu. There are Indian
Mahomedans, sixty-two million of them; Indian Buddhists, a few&mdash;the
great majority of the Buddhists in the "Indian Empire" being in Burmah,
not in India proper; there are Indian Christians, about three million in
number; and there are Indian Parsees. A Hindu is the man who professes
Hinduism.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31" /><a href=
"#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Where is Hindustan?</div>

<p><i>Hindustan</i>, or the land of the Hindus, is a term that never had
any geographical definiteness. In the mouths of Indians it meant the
central portion of the plain of North India; in English writers of half a
century ago it was often used when all India was meant. In exact writing
of the present time, the term is practically obsolete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who speak Hindustani?</div>

<p>Unfortunately for clearness, the term <i>Hindustani</i> not only
survives, but survives in a variety <!-- Page 67 --><a name="Page_67" id=
"Page_67" />of significations. The word is an adjective, <i>pertaining to
Hindustan</i>, and in English it has become the name either of the people
of Hindustan or of their language. It is in the latter sense that the name
is particularly confusing. The way out of the difficulty lies in first
associating <i>Hindustani</i> clearly with the central region of
Hindustan, the country to the north-east of Agra and Delhi. These were the
old imperial capitals, be it remembered. Then from that centre, the
Hindustani language spread&mdash;a central, imperial, Persianised language
not necessarily superseding the other vernaculars&mdash;wherever the
authority of the empire went. Thus throughout India, Hindustani became a
<i>lingua franca</i>, the imperial language. In the Moghul Empire of
Northern India it was exactly what "King's English" was in the
Anglo-Norman kingdom in England in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. French was the language of the Anglo-Norman court of London, as
Persian of the court of Delhi or Agra; the Frenchified King's English was
the court form of the vernacular in England, as the Persianised Hindustani
in North India. It was this <i>lingua franca</i> that Europeans in India
set themselves to acquire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Urdu literature</div>

<p>Continuing the English parallel&mdash;the Hindustani <!-- Page 68 --><a
name="Page_68" id="Page_68" />of Delhi, the capital, Persianised as the
English of London was Frenchified, became the recognised literary medium
for North India. The special name <i>Urdu</i>, however, has now superseded
the term <i>Hindustani</i>, when we think of the language as a literary
medium. <i>Urdu</i> is the name for literary Hindustani; in the Calcutta
University Calendar, for example, the name <i>Hindustani</i> never
occurs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hindi language and literature</div>

<p>About the beginning of the nineteenth century another dialect of
Hindustani, called <i>Hindi</i>, also gained a literary standing. It
contains much less of Persian than Urdu does, leaning rather to Sanscrit;
it is written in the deva-nagari or Sanscrit character; is associated with
Hindus and with the eastern half of Hindustan; whereas Urdu is written in
the Persian character, and is associated with Mahomedans and the western
half of Hindustan.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32" /><a href=
"#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Brahmans</div>

<p>Another series of terms are likewise a puzzle to the uninitiated. To
Westerns, the <i>brahmans</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id=
"FNanchor_33_33" /><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
<!-- Page 69 --><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" />are best known as the
priests of the Hindus; more correctly, however, the name <i>brahman</i>
signifies not the performer of priestly duties, but the caste that
possesses a monopoly of the performance. The brahman caste is the Hindu
<i>Tribe of Levi</i>. Every accepted Hindu priest is a brahman, although
it is far from being the case that every brahman is a priest. As a matter
of fact, at the Census of 1901 it was found that the great majority of
brahmans have turned aside from their traditional calling. In Bengal
proper, only about 16 per cent. of the brahmans were following priestly
pursuits; in the Madras Presidency, 11.4 per cent.; and in the Bombay
Presidency, 22 per cent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brahmanism.</div>

<p><i>Brahmanism</i> is being employed by a number of recent writers in
place of the older <i>Hinduism</i>. Sir Alfred Lyall uses <i>
Brahmanism</i> in that sense; likewise Professor Menzies in his recent
book, <i>Brahmanism and Buddhism</i>. Sir Alfred Lyall's employment of the
term <i>Brahmanism</i> rather than <i>Hinduism</i>, is in keeping with his
description of Hinduism, which he defines as the congeries of diverse
local beliefs and practices that are held together by the employment of
brahmans as priests. The description is a true one; the term Brahmanism
represents what is common to the<!-- Page 70 --><a name="Page_70" id=
"Page_70" /> Hindu castes and sects; it is their greatest common measure,
as it were. But yet the fact remains that <i>Hindus</i> speak of
themselves as such, not as <i>Brahmanists</i>, and it is hopeless to try
to supersede a current name. Sir M. Monier Williams employs the term <i>
Brahmanism</i> in a more limited and more legitimate sense. Dividing the
history of the Hindu religion into three periods, he calls them the stages
of Vedism, Brahmanism, and Hinduism respectively. The first is the period
of the Vedas, or earliest sacred books; the second, of the Brahman
philosophy, fundamentally pantheistic; the third is the period of "a
confused tangle of divine personalities and incarnations." Sir M. Monier
Williams' standard work on the religion of the Hindus is "<i>Brahmanism
and Hinduism."</i> "Hinduism," he tells us, "is Brahmanism modified by the
creeds and superstitions of Buddhists and non-Aryans of all kinds."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brahm&#257;, Brahma.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Br&#257;hmas</div>

<p>We are not done with this confusing set of terms. <i>Brahm&#257;</i> is
the first person of the Hindu divine triad&mdash;the Creator&mdash;who
along with the other two persons of the triad, has proceeded from a divine
essence, <i>Brahma</i> or <i>Brahm</i>. Brahma is Godhead or Deity:
Brahm&#257;, is <i>a</i> Deity, a divine <i>person</i> who has emanated
from <!-- Page 71 --><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />the Godhead, Brahma.
<i>Br&#257;hmas</i> or theists, believers in Brahma, are a religious body
that originated in Bengal in the nineteenth century. Repudiating caste,
idolatry, and transmigration, they are necessarily cut off from Hinduism.
The body is called the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j, that is, the Theistic
Association. Enough for the present; in their respective places these
distinctions can be more fully gone into.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideas of citizenship and public questions.</div>

<p>With modern education and the awakening of the Indian mind have come
entirely new political ideas. That there are public questions has in fact
been discovered; for in India the idea of citizenship, the consciousness
of being a political unit, was itself a new idea. We may say that it was
made possible in 1835, when an Act of Legislature was passed declaring the
press free. In 1823 an English editor had been deported from Calcutta for
free criticism of the authorities, but after 1835 it was legal not merely
to think but to speak on public questions. Before we pass on, we note the
strange inverted sequence of events which may attend on fostered liberty.
The right to criticise <!-- Page 73 --><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73" />was bestowed before any right to be represented in the
Legislature or Executive was enjoyed. In this freedom to criticise the
acts of Government, the India of to-day is far ahead of countries like
Germany and Russia.</p>

<p>The new idea of citizenship, thus made possible by a free press, is
largely the outcome of three great influences. Christian philanthropic
ideas, disseminated both by precept and example, could not but be
producing some sense of brotherhood, and what Burke calls a "civil
society." Then again, the free and often democratic spirit of English
literature was being imbibed by thousands; and in the third place, through
the newspapers, English and vernacular, the people were being brought into
actual contact with the political life of Great Britain. Due particularly
to the first of these influences, the noblest of the new Indian political
ideas is that tacitly assumed in many of the native criticisms of the
British Government in India&mdash;high tribute as well as
criticism&mdash;that Government exists for the good of the governed, and
indeed responsible for the welfare of the masses. The British Government
is indeed an amazing network covering the whole continent, ministering
life, like the network of the blood-vessels in our frame.
<!-- Page 74 --><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />At least, its apologists
declare it <i>to be doing so</i>, and its native critics declare that it
<i>ought to</i>. The native press, for example, is prompt to direct the
attention of the Government to famine and to summon the Government to its
duty. In India a noble idea of the Commonwealth and its proper government
has thus come into being. Likewise, it ought to be added, except in times
of political excitement, and in the case of professional politicians, it
is generally acknowledged that the conception of the British Government in
India is noble, and that many officers of Government are truly the
servants of the people. It is not suggested that the policy or the methods
should be radically altered. The politician's theme is that the Government
is more expensive and less sympathetic than it might be, because of the
employment of alien Europeans where natives might be employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new national consciousness.</div>

<div class="sidenote">English rule, a chief cause.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The very name <i>Indian</i> is English.</div>

<p>Other new political ideas follow the lines of social change. We have
seen how in the modern school, the idea of caste gives way before the idea
of rank in the school, to be followed in College by the idea of
intellectual distinction, and still later in life by the idea of success
in some modern career. In the political sphere, modern life is
<!-- Page 75 --><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" />also busy dissolving the
older and narrower conceptions of life. Atop of the sectarian
consciousness of being a Hindu or the provincial consciousness of
belonging to Bengal or Bombay, is coming the consciousness of being an
Indian. This consciousness of a national unity is one of the outstanding
features of the time in India, all the more striking because hitherto
India has been so unwieldily large, and her people incoherent, like dry
sand. "The Indian never knew the feeling of nationality," says Max
M&uuml;ller. "The very name of India is a synonym for caste, as opposed to
nationality," says Sister Nivedita, the pro-Hindu lady already referred
to, who likewise notes the emergence of the national idea.<a name=
"FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35" /><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a> "Public spirit or patriotism, as we understand it,
never existed among the Hindus," writes Mr. Bose, himself an Indian,
author of a recent work on <i>Hindu Civilisation under British Rule</i>.<a
name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36" /><a href="#Footnote_36_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And Raja Rammohan Roy, the famous Bengali
reformer of the beginning of the nineteenth century, we have already heard
denouncing the caste system as "destructive of national union." From what
then, during the nineteenth century, has the national consciousness come
forth? Many causes may be <!-- Page 76 --><a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76" />cited. The actual unification effected by the postal, the
telegraph, and the railway organisation, has done much. The omnipresence
of the foreign government, all-controlling, has also done much. The
current coins and the postage stamps with King Edward's head upon
them&mdash;the same all over India, a few native states
excepted&mdash;bring home the union of India to the most ignorant. The
constant criticism of the Government in the native press, the meetings of
the All-India political association called the Congress, and the fact that
modern interests, stimulated by daily telegrams from all over the world,
are international, not provincial or sectarian&mdash;all these things
combine to give to the modern educated Indian a new Indian national
consciousness in place of the old provincial and sectarian one. In short,
the British rule has united India, and the awakened mind of India is
rejoicing in the consciousness of the larger existence, and is identifying
the ancient glories of certain centres in North India with this new India
created by Britain. Never before was there a united India in the modern
political sense; never, indeed, could there be until modern inventions
brought distant places near each other. Two great Indian empires there
certainly were in <!-- Page 77 --><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />the
third century B.C. and the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., and the
paternal benevolence of Asoka, the great Buddhist emperor of the third
century B.C., deserves record and all honour. Let Indians know definitely
who deserves to be called an ancient Indian emperor, when they wish to
lament a lost past; and descending to historical fact and detail, let them
compare that period with the present. The later empire referred to was an
empire only in the old sense of a collection of vassal states. Turning
back to the hoary past, in which many Indians, even of education, imagine
there was a golden Indian empire, we can trace underneath the ancient
epic, the Ramayan, a conquering progress southward to Ceylon itself of a
great Aryan hero, Ram. But of any Indian empire founded by him, we know
nothing. "One who has carefully studied the Ramayan will be impressed with
the idea that the Aryan conquest had spread over parts of Northern India
only, at the time of the great events which form its subjects."<a name=
"FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37" /><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class=
"fnanchor">[37]</a> Coming down to the period of the greatest extent of
the Moghul empire in India in the end of the seventeenth century, we find
the Emperor Aurangzeb with as extensive a military <!-- Page 78 --><a
name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />empire as that of Asoka, but with the
Mahrattas rising behind him even while he was extending his empire
southwards. That decadent military despotism cannot be thought of as a
union of India. In truth, the old Aryan conquest of India was not a
political conquest, and never has been; it was a conquest, very complete
in the greater part of India, of new social usages and certain new
religious ideas. The first complete political conquest of India by Aryans
was the British conquest, and the ideas which have come in or been
awakened thereby, we are now engaged in tracing. As regards the new idea
of nationality, we have noted that the new national name <i>Indian</i> now
heard upon political platforms, is not a native term, but an importation
from Britain along with the English language. How, indeed, could the
educated Indian employ any other term with the desired comprehensiveness?
If he speak of <i>Hindus</i>, he excludes Mahomedans and followers of
other religions; if he use a Sanscrit term for <i>Indians</i>, he still
fails to touch the hearts of Mahomedans and others who identify Sanscrit
with Hindus. There is no course left but to use the English language, even
while criticising the British rulers. The English language has been a
prime factor in <!-- Page 79 --><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" />evoking
the new national consciousness, and in the English language the Indian
must speak to his new found fellow Indians.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id=
"FNanchor_38_38" /><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Even a considerable portion of the literature of the attempted Revival of
Hinduism is in English, strange as the conjunction sounds.</p>

<p>How the thought of Indian unity over against the sovereignty of Britain
may reach down even to the humblest, the writer once observed in a humble
street in Calcutta. A working man was receiving his farthing's worth of
entertainment from a peep-show. His eyes were glued to the peepholes, to
secure his money's worth, for the farthing was no small sum to him; and
the showman was standing by describing the successive scenes in a loud
voice, with intent both to serve his customer and to stimulate the
bystanders' curiosity. Three of the scenes were: "This is the house of the
great Queen near London city," "This is one of the great Queen's lords
writing an order to the Viceroy of Calcutta," "This is the great committee
that sits in London city." He actually used the English word <i>
committee</i>, the picture probably showing the House of
<!-- Page 80 --><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />Commons or the House of
Lords. Thus the political constitution of India and its unity under
Britain are inculcated among the humblest. In the minds of the educated,
one need not then be surprised at the growth of a sense of Indian unity
over against British supremacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Indian National Congress.</div>

<div class="sidenote">English, the <i>lingua franca</i> of the
Congress.</div>

<p>The Indian National Congress, or All-India political association, is
the embodiment of this new national consciousness of educated Indians, the
only embodiment possible while India is so divided in social and religious
matters. Were there only ten or twelve million Mahomedans in India instead
of sixty, the new national consciousness would undoubtedly have been a
Hindu or religious, instead of a political, consciousness. But in matters
religious, Hindu looks across a gulf at Mahomedan, and Mahomedan at Hindu,
neither expecting the other to cross over. Christianity, third in numbers
in India proper, proclaims the Christian Gospel to both Hindus and
Mahomedans, but is regarded by both as an alien.<a name="FNanchor_39_39"
id="FNanchor_39_39" /><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Nor is any All-India <i>social</i> movement possible while social
differences are so sacred as they are. But politically, all India <i>
is</i> already <i>one</i>; her educated men have drunk at <i>one</i>
<!-- Page 81 --><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" />well of political ideas;
citizenship and its rights are attractive and destroy no cherished
customs; and in the English language there is a new <i>lingua franca</i>
in unison with the new ideas. The Indian National Congress is the natural
outcome. There, representatives of races which a hundred years ago made
war on one another, of castes that never either eat together or
intermarry, now fraternise in one peaceful assembly, inspired by the novel
idea that they are citizens. The Congress meets annually in December in
one or other of the cities of India. The first meeting at Bombay in 1885
has been described as follows<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id=
"FNanchor_40_40" /><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>:
"There were men from Madras, the blackness of whose complexions seemed to
be made blacker by spotless white turbans which some of them wore. A few
others hailing from the same Presidency were in simplest native fashion,
bareheaded and barefooted and otherwise lightly clad, their bodies from
the waist upwards being only partially protected by muslin shawls. They
had preferred to retain their national dress and manners; and in this
respect they presented a marked contrast to the delegates from Bengal.
Some of these appeared in entirely European <!-- Page 82 --><a name=
"Page_82" id="Page_82" />costume, while others could easily be recognised
as Bengalis by the peculiar cap with a flap behind which they had donned.
None of them wore the gold rings or diamond pendants which adorned the
ears of some of the Madrassees; nor had they their foreheads painted like
their more orthodox and more conservative brethren from the Southern
presidency. There were Hindustanis from Delhi, Agra, and Lucknow, some of
whom wore muslin skull-caps and dresses chiefly made of the same fine
cloth. There were delegates from the North-West&mdash;bearded, bulky, and
large-limbed men&mdash;in their coats and flowing robes of different hues,
and in turbans like those worn by Sikh soldiers. There were stalwart
Sindhees from Karachee wearing their own tall hat surmounted by a broad
brim at top instead of bottom. In the strange assemblage were to be
observed the familiar figures of Banyas from Gujarat, of Mahrattas in
their cart-wheel turbans, and of Parsees in their not very elegant
head-dress, likened to a slanting roof. Assembled in the same hall, they
presented a variety of costumes and complexions scarcely to be witnessed
except at a fancy ball." Now and again, we may add, a speaker expresses
himself in a vernacular, and with the inborn Indian courtesy
<!-- Page 83 --><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" />and patience the assembly
will listen; but the language of the motley gathering is English; the
address of the president and his rulings are in English; the protests,
claims, and resolutions of the Congress are in English. For in the sphere
of politics, the new national feeling <i>confessedly</i> looks to Britain
for ideals. Apologies for India's social customs and for her religious
ideas and ideals are not wanting in India at the present time, for in
matters social and religious, as we shall see, the political reformers are
often ardently conservative, or pro-Indian at least. But in the sphere of
politics it is the complete democratic constitution of Britain that looms
before India's leaders. Britons can view with sympathy the rise of the
national feeling as the natural and inevitable fruit of contact with
Britain and of education in the language of freedom, and even although the
new problems of Indian statesmanship may call forth all the powers of
British statesmen. Like a young man conscious of noble lineage and of
great intellectual power, New India, brought up under Britain's care, is
loudly asserting that she can now take over the management of the
continent which Britain has unified and made what it is.</p>

<p>Where the "National Congress" and the <!-- Page 84 --><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84" />Congress ideas have sprung from is manifest when she first
presents herself upon the Indian stage. As her first president she has a
distinguished barrister of Calcutta, Mr. W.C. Bonnerjee, of brahman caste
by birth, but out of caste altogether because of frequent visits to
Britain. Patriot though he is&mdash;nay, rather, as a true patriot, he has
broken and cast away the shackles of caste. His English education is
manifest when he opens his lips, for in India there is no more complete
master of the English language, and very few greater masters will be found
even in Britain. Further, as her first General Secretary and general
moving spirit, the first Congress has a Scotchman, Mr. A.O. Hume, commonly
known as the "Father of the Congress." His leading of the Congress we can
understand when we know that he is the son of the celebrated reformer and
member of Parliament, the late Dr. Joseph Hume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Representative Government.</div>

<p>Several of the claims of the Congress have been conceded in whole or in
part. Since the first meeting in 1885, elected members have been added to
the Legislative Councils in the three chief provinces, Bengal, Madras, and
Bombay, and new Legislative Councils set up in the United Provinces and
the Punjab. To the Council for <!-- Page 85 --><a name="Page_85" id=
"Page_85" />all India, the Viceroy's Council, also have been added five
virtually elected members, out of a council now numbering about twenty-two
members in all. Four of the new members represent the chief provinces, and
the fifth the Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta. Other five the Viceroy
nominates to represent other provinces or other interests. Looking at the
representation of Indians, it is noteworthy that in 1880 only two Indians
had seats in the Viceroy's Council, whereas in 1905 there were no fewer
than six. The Provincial Legislative Council of Bombay will suffice as
illustration of the stage which Representative Government has now reached.
Eight of the twenty-two members are virtually elected. That is to say,
certain bodies nominate representatives, and only in most exceptional
circumstances would the Governor refuse to accept the nominees. And who
make the nominations? Who are the electors enjoying the new political
citizenship of India? We shall not expect that the electors are "the
people" in the British or American sense: no Congress yet asks for
political rights for them. The idea regarding citizenship still is that it
is a royal concession, as it were to royal burghs, not that it is one of
the rights of men. The University<!-- Page 86 --><a name="Page_86" id=
"Page_86" /> elects a member to the Governor's Council, for it has
intelligence and can make its voice heard; the Corporation of Bombay
elects a representative, for in the capital are concentrated the
enlightenment and the wealth of the province; the importance of the
British merchants must be recognised, and so the Chambers of Commerce of
Bombay and Karachi send each a representative. Other groups of
municipalities elect one; the boards of certain country districts elect
one; and finally two groups of landlords elect one representative each. It
comes to this, that the men of learning, the burgesses of the chief towns,
the British traders, and the landowners and country gentlemen, have now a
measure of citizenship in the modern sense of the word.</p>

<p>The same feeling of citizenship has been given recognition to in 759
towns, whose municipalities are now partly elected, the right of election
having been greatly extended by the Local Self-Government Acts of 1882-84.
In these Municipalities even more than in the higher Councils the new
educated Indian comes to the front. According to the roll of voters, it is
property that enjoys the municipal franchise; emphatically so, for a
wealthy citizen of Calcutta might conceivably cast three<!-- Page 87 --><a
name="Page_87" id="Page_87" /> hundred votes for his Municipality
throughout the twenty-five wards of the city; but they are
English-speaking Indians in all cases who are returned as members.
Politically, this is the day of the English-educated Indians. Such is the
stage of the recognition of this new idea of citizenship in India. The
idea represents a great advance during the British period, although,
broadly speaking, it has not yet reached the stage of British opinion
prior to 1832. Nevertheless one feels justified in saying that in present
circumstances the desire of the educated class for a measure of
citizenship has been reasonably met. Of course at the examination for the
Indian Civil Service, held annually in London, the Indian competes on a
complete equality with all the youth of the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cleavage of opinion&mdash;European <i>v.</i>
Native.</div>

<p>An unpleasant aspect of the new idea is much in evidence at the present
time. On almost every public question, the cleavage of the public opinion
is Europeans <i>versus</i> Natives. Far be it from me to assert that the
natives only are carried away by the community feeling. A case in point is
the violence of the European agitation over the "Ilbert Bill" of 1883, to
permit trial of Europeans by native judges in rural criminal courts. Our
question merely is: How has the new regime affected native ideas? Given
then, say, a charge of assault upon a native by a European or Eurasian, or
the reverse&mdash;a case by no means unknown&mdash;the native press and
the class they represent are <!-- Page 89 --><a name="Page_89" id=
"Page_89" />ranged at once, as a matter of course, upon the native's side.
Given a great public matter, like Lord Curzon's Bill of 1903 for the
necessary reform of the Indian Universities, immediately educated Indians
and the native press perceive in it a veiled attempt to limit the higher
education in order to diminish the political weight of the educated class.
The 1904 expedition into Thibet was unanimously approved by the
Anglo-Indian, and as unanimously disapproved by the native press. Educated
India no doubt joined with the rest of the Empire in wishing success to
Japan in the 1904-5 war with Russia, but the war presented itself
primarily to the Indian mind as a great struggle between Asia and Europe.
Other lines of cleavage may temporarily show themselves,&mdash;among
natives the division into Hindus and Mahomedans, or into officials and
non-officials; but on the first occasion when a European and a Native are
opposed, or when the Government takes any step, the minor fissures close,
and the new consciousness of nationality unites the Indians. European
lines of cleavage like the division between capital and labour or between
commerce and land have not yet risen above the Indian horizon.</p>

<p><!-- Page 90 --><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />The Indian Christian
community occupies the peculiar position of sharing in the new-born
national consciousness as strongly as any, and yet of being identified
with the British side in the eyes of the Hindu and Mahomedan
communities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anti-British bias.</div>

<div class="sidenote">India ruled by Indians.</div>

<p>Thus, almost inevitably, an anti-British bias has been generated, one
of the noteworthy and regrettable changes in the Indian mind within the
last half-century. Probably many would declare that the unifying national
consciousness of which I have spoken is nothing more than a racial
anti-British bias. At all events, hear an independent Indian witness
regarding the bias.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41" /><a href=
"#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> "There is a strong and strange
ferment working in certain ranks of Indian society.... Instead of looking
upon the English rulers as their real benefactors, they are beginning to
view their actions suspiciously, seizing every opportunity of criticising
and censuring their rulers.... The race feeling between rulers and ruled,
instead of diminishing, has increased with the increase, and spread with
the spread, of literary education. That all this is more or less true at
present cannot be denied by an impartial political observer." An
up-to-date illustration of the bias <!-- Page 91 --><a name="Page_91" id=
"Page_91" />appears in the address of the Chairman of the National
Congress of 1906. "The educated classes," he says, "... now see clearly
that the [British] bureaucracy is growing frankly selfish and openly
opposed to their political aspirations." While regretting that feeling and
the prejudice that often mingles with it, let those interested in India at
least understand the feeling. It is the natural outcome of the new
national consciousness. Even educated natives are in general too ignorant
of India, past and present, to appreciate the debt of India to Britain,
and how great a share of the administration of India they
themselves&mdash;the educated Indians&mdash;actually enjoy. For every
subordinate executive position in the vast imperial organisation is held
by a native of India, and "almost the entire original jurisdiction of
Civil Justice has passed out of the hands of Europeans into those of
Indians."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42" /><a href=
"#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> But the anti-British bias, let
us on our part understand. The attitude of educated Indians to the British
Government of India, and to Anglo-Indians as a body, is that of a
political opposition, ignorant of many pertinent facts, divided from the
party in power by racial and religious differences, and with
<!-- Page 92 --><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />no visible prospect of
succeeding to office. The National Congress is the permanent Opposition in
India. A permanent Opposition cannot but be biassed, and its press will
seize at everything that will justify the feeling of hostility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrations of the bias: Famines.</div>

<p>An outstanding illustration of the anti-British spirit is the
frequently expressed opinion that the Indian famines are a result of
British rule, or at all events have been aggravated thereby. The reasoning
is that India is being financially drained to the amount of between thirty
and forty millions sterling a year, and that the people of India have thus
no staying fund to keep them going when famine comes. Having said this, we
ought perhaps to quote the opinion (1903), on the other side, of Mr. A.P.
Sinnett, ex-editor of one of the leading Indian newspapers, and, as a
theosophist, very unlikely to be prejudiced in favour of Britain. He
insists "that loss of life in famine time is infinitesimal compared with
what it used to be." "As for impoverishment," he goes on to say, "we have
poured European capital into the country by scores of millions for public
works and the establishment of factories, and we have enriched India
instead of impoverishing it to an extent that makes the Home
Charges&mdash;of which such agitators as Digby always exaggerate the
<!-- Page 93 --><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" />importance&mdash;a mere
trifle in the balance." Lord Curzon's statement of three or four years
back was that there were eight hundred and twenty-five crores of rupees
(five hundred and fifty millions sterling) of buried capital in India; and
he might have added the easily ascertainable fact that the sum is yearly
being added to. The anti-British idea was put forward in 1885 by the late
Mr. William Digby, an ardent supporter of the Congress; the Congress
adopted it in one of its resolutions in 1896, and the idea has lamentably
caught on. In 1897 a Conference of Indians resident in London did not
mince their language. In their opinion, "of all the evils and terrible
misery that India has been suffering for a century and a half, and of
which the latest developments are the most deplorable famine and plague
arising from ever-increasing poverty,... the main cause is the unrighteous
and un-British system of Government, which produces an unceasing and ever
increasing bleeding of the country," etc. etc.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id=
"FNanchor_43_43" /><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Such language, such ideas, do not call for refutation, here at least; they
are symptoms only of a state of mind now prevailing, out of which educated
India must surely grow.</p>

<p><!-- Page 94 --><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />Nor need it be
forgotten that the rise of the anti-British feeling was foreseen and
political danger apprehended when the question of English education for
natives of India was under discussion. A former Governor-General, Lord
Ellenborough, declared to a committee of the House of Commons in 1852,
that England must not expect to retain her hold on India if English ideas
were imparted to the people. "No <i>intelligent</i> people would submit to
our Government," were his words&mdash;a sentiment repudiated with
indignation by the learned Bengali, the late Rev. Dr. K.M. Banerjea. In
the same spirit, apparently, Sir Alfred Lyall still contemplates with some
fear the rapid reformation of religious beliefs under modern influences.
He sees that the old deities and ideas are being dethroned, and that the
responsibility for famines, formerly imputed to the gods, is being cast
upon the British Government. "The British Government," he says, "having
thrown aside these lightning conductors [the old theocratic system], is
much more exposed than a native ruler would be to shocks from famines or
other wide-spread misfortunes." "Where no other authority is recognised,
the visible ruler becomes responsible for everything."<a name=
"FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44" /><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a> Fortunately, "policy" of that <!-- Page 95 --><a name=
"Page_95" id="Page_95" />sort has not prevailed with Indian statesmen in
the past, and Britain can still retain self-respect as enlightener and
ruler of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Championing of things Indian.</div>

<p>The championing of all things Indian is another recent phase of the
same national consciousness. As the work of Britain is depreciated, the
heroes, the beliefs, and the practices of India are exalted and defended
as such. Idolatry and caste have their apologists. At almost every public
meeting, according to the late Mr. Monomohun Ghose of Calcutta, he heard
the remark made "that the ancient civilisation of India was far superior
to that which Europe ever had."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id=
"FNanchor_45_45" /><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In
the political lament over a golden past, there is glorification by Hindus
of the Mahomedan emperor Akbar, praise of the Native States and their rule
as opposed to the condition of British India, and there are apologies for
leaders in the Mutiny of 1857. Much of that is natural and proper
patriotism, no doubt, and no one would deny the ancient glories of India
or the many admirable characteristics of the people of India to-day. It is
the self-deceiving patriotism, the blind ancestor-worship, of which we are
speaking as a phase of modern opinion. As an instance when
<!-- Page 96 --><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" />Indians certainly did
themselves injustice by this spirit, we may single out the celebrated
trial in 1897 of the Hon. Mr. Tilak, member of the Legislative Council of
the Governor of Bombay. The Mahrattas of Western India look back to Sivaji
as the founder of their political power, which lasted down to 1817, and
have lately instituted an annual celebration of Sivaji as the hero of the
Mahratta race. One great blot rests on Sivaji's career. In one campaign he
invited the Mahomedan general opposing him to a personal conference, and
stabbed him while in the act of embracing him. It was at one of these
Sivaji celebrations in 1897 that Mr. Tilak abandoned himself to the
pro-Indian and anti-British feeling, glorifying Sivaji's use of the knife
upon foreigners. "Great men are above common principles of law," ... he
said. "In killing Afzal Khan did Sivaji sin?" ... "In the Bhagabat Gita,"
he replied to himself, "Krishna has counselled the assassination of even
one's preceptors and blood relations.... If thieves enter one's house, and
one's wrists have no strength to drive them out, one may without
compunction shut them in and burn them. God Almighty did not give a
charter ... to the foreigners to rule India, Sivaji strove to drive
<!-- Page 97 --><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />them out of his
fatherland, and there is no sin of covetousness in that." Practical
application of Mr. Tilak's language was soon forthcoming in the
assassination of two British officers in the same city of Poona. Mr.
Tilak, victim of his own eloquence and of the spirit of the day, was
necessarily prosecuted for his inflammatory speech, and was sent to prison
for eighteen months. But it is not too much to say that the <i>
unanimous</i> feeling of educated India went with Mr. Tilak and regarded
him as a martyr.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boycott of British goods.</div>

<p>From the pro-Indian feeling to the anti-British Boycott feeling is only
one step along the road that new-educated India is treading. The boycott
of British goods in 1905 has been the next step. The provocation alleged
by the politicians who organised the boycott was the division of the
province of Bengal. Whether that was cause sufficient to justify the
boycott or a mere pretext for another anti-British step is now of
secondary importance. The plea of encouragement of native industries we
may set aside as an afterthought. The boycott has been declared, and what
concerns us is to see the national feeling now take the form of a
declaration of commercial war upon Great Britain&mdash;none the less
disconcerting because some of those concerned clearly have an eye, however
<!-- Page 98 --><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />foolishly, upon Boston in
1773 and the war thereafter. It gives pause to India's well-wishers.
"India for the Indians," will that come next? There no friend of India
dare wish her success, to be a possible prey to Russia or Germany, or even
to Japan. But reasoning to the logical issue, we get light upon our
premisses. <i>India for what Indians?</i>, we ask ourselves. For Hindus or
Mahomedans; for the million, English-speaking, or the many-millioned
masses? For many a day yet to come it will be Britain's duty to hold the
balance, to instruct in self-government and to learn from her
blunders.</p>

<p>That the national feeling of Indians may become a main strand in a
strong Imperial feeling, as is the national feeling of Scotland, must be
the wish of all friends of India. But how is the Indian feeling to be
transformed?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedies.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Instruction in History and Political Economy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">High-minded Anglo-Indians.</div>

<p>The new Social Ideas of India have asserted themselves in spite of
opposing ideas, deep-rooted; on the other hand, the new Political Ideas
are in accordance with the natural ambition of educated Indians, and have
had no difficulty in expanding and spreading. In comparison with the new
social ideas, in consequence, the new political ideas are a somewhat rank
and artificial growth, forced <!-- Page 99 --><a name="Page_99" id=
"Page_99" />by editors and politicians, and warped by ignorance and
prejudice. The widely current idea that, owing to British rule, the
poverty of the Indian people is now greater, and that the famines are more
frequent and severe than in former dynasties, is the outstanding instance
of the rank growth. Neither the allegation of greater poverty nor the
causes of the acknowledged low standard of living have been studied except
in the fashion of party politicians. Another of the ideas, as widely
current, is that every ton of rice or wheat exported is an injury to the
poor. A third is that the payments made in Britain by the Government of
India are virtually tribute, meanly exacted, instead of honest payment for
cash received and for services rendered. Again, what can be the remedy? In
the early part of the nineteenth century, the Foreign Mission Committee of
the Church of Scotland objected to Dr. Duff, their missionary, teaching
Political Economy in the Church's Mission College, the General Assembly's
Institution, Calcutta. They feared lest the East India Company would deem
it an interference in politics.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id=
"FNanchor_46_46" /><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In
1897, after the Tilak case already referred to, the writer on Indian
affairs in <i>The Times</i> <!-- Page 100 --><a name="Page_100" id=
"Page_100" />complained of the teaching of historical half-truths and
untruths in Indian schools and colleges, instancing the partisan writings
of Burke and Macaulay, and many Indian text-books full of glaring
historical perversions. The remedy for such erroneous ideas is certainly
not to withhold the present dole of knowledge, but to teach the whole
truth. The recent History of India and Political Economy with reference to
India should be compulsory subjects for every student in an Indian
University. It ought to be the policy of Government to select the ablest
men for professors and teachers of such subjects. If, along with that
remedy, more Anglo-Indians would take a high view of their mission to
India, and of their residence in that country, much of that regrettable
bias and bitterness on the part of Indians would surely pass away. If
instead of adopting the attitude of exiles, thinking only of the
termination of the exile and how to while away the interval, Anglo-Indians
would take some interest in something Indian outside their business, much
would be gained! The best Anglo-Indians are eager to promote intercourse
between Europeans and Indians, but many Anglo-Indians, whatever the cause,
seem incapable of friendly intercourse. On <!-- Page 101 --><a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101" />the matters that should interest both them and
their fellow-citizens in India, they have in them nothing save unreasoned
feelings. These form the numerous class, of whom Sir Henry Cotton spoke in
an address in London in February 1904, to whom it is an offence to travel
in the same railway-carriage with Indians. These are the corrupters of
good feeling between Britons and Indians, as sympathetic men are the salt
that preserves what good feeling may still exist. In every Indian sphere
the men of the latter class are well known to the native community, and
are always spoken of with cordiality. The writer remembers trying to have
a talk with a British soldier about the generals of the army, and how the
man seemed unable to do more than say, with enthusiasm, of Lord Roberts
and General Wauchope and others, "Yon was a man!" and as depreciatorily of
others again, "Yon was no man at all." Such sympathetic "men,"
instinctively discerned, India has much need of, if this anti-British
feeling, so far as it is not inevitable, is to be checked. In such "men"
the new Indian feelings of manhood and citizenship and nationality will
find recognition and response, in spite of displeasing accompaniments, for
such feelings we must look for under <!-- Page 102 --><a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102" />British rule and from English and Christian education.
From such "men," also, the new Indians will accept frank condemnation of
social irrationalities or political exaggerations, as <i>e.g.</i> the
notion that those have right to claim full share in the British Empire's
management who would outcaste a fellow-Indian for visiting Britain, even
had he gone to state their case before the House of Commons. To speak of
laymen only, there are no Anglo-Indians more trusted than those who make
no secret of their desire for the advancement of India's welfare through a
religious reformation, who hold that this purely pro-Indian national
feeling is as yet imperfect because divorced from the idea of the unity of
mankind and the concomitant idea of the progress of the whole race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Renaissance without a reformation.</div>

<p>It would be interesting to speculate what the Renaissance of the
sixteenth century would have done for Europe had it been unaccompanied by
a Reformation of religion. Without the Reformation, we may aver there
would have been for the British nation no Bible of 1611, no Pilgrim
Fathers to America, and no Revolution of 1688, along with all that these
things imply of progress many-fold. What might have been, however,
although interesting as a speculation, is too uncertain to be discussed
further with profit. <!-- Page 104 --><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />I
only desire to give a general idea of the religious situation in India at
the close of the nineteenth century. There has been a Renaissance without
a Reformation.</p>

<p>Into the new intellectual world the Hindu mind has willingly entered,
but progress in religious ideas has been slow and reluctant. The new <i>
political</i> idea of the unity of India and the consciousness of
citizenship were pleasing discoveries that met with no opposition; but
that same new Indian national consciousness resented any departure from
the old <i>social</i> and <i>religious</i> ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meaning of the term <i>religious</i>.</div>

<p>In speaking of the development of religious ideas in India, I use the
term <i>religious</i> in the modern sense. Under religion, in India is
comprehended much that in Europe would be reckoned within the <i>
social</i> sphere. In India all questions of inter-marriage and of eating
together, many questions regarding occupations and the relations of
earning members of a family to idle members, are religious not social
questions.</p>

<p>The case was similar among the Jews, we may remember. As recorded in
the fifteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, two of the three
injunctions of the Jerusalem Church to the Gentile Church at Antioch deal
with these same <!-- Page 105 --><a name="Page_105" id=
"Page_105" />socio-religious matters. Blood and animals killed by
strangling were to be prohibited as food, and certain marriages also were
forbidden.</p>

<p>Perhaps among Europeans the question of burial <i>v</i>. cremation may
be instanced as a matter of social custom that has been made a religious
question. But in no country more than in India have customs, <i>mores</i>,
come also to mean morals. A halo of religious sanctity encircles the
things that have been and are. Taking "religion," however, in the modern
sense, we ask: Although there has not been any great Reformation of
religion, have religious ideas undergone no noteworthy development? It is
well to put the question definitely with regard to religion, although in
the opening chapter abundant testimony to a general change in ideas has
already been cited. There <i>is</i> no lack of specific evidence as to
religious changes, and the adoption of certain Christian ideas.</p>

<p>Sir Alfred Lyall's observations let us first of all recall, for he
possesses all the experience of an Indian Civil Servant and Governor of a
Province&mdash;the United Provinces. He speaks both for officials and for
Europeans conversant with India.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id=
"FNanchor_47_47" /><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Speaking in the person of an orthodox brahman surveying
<!-- Page 106 --><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" />the moral and material
changes that English rule is producing in India, he says: "We are parting
rapidly under ... this Public Instruction with our religious beliefs." The
old brahman warns the British Government that the old deities are being
dethroned, and that the responsibility for famines, formerly imputed to
the gods, is being cast upon the British Government. Another official
witness speaks still more plainly. <i>The Bengal Government Report</i>
upon the publications of the year 1899 asserts: "All this revolution in
the religious belief of the educated Hindu has been brought about as much
by the dissemination of Christian thought by missionaries as by the study
of Hindu scriptures; for Christian influence is detectable in many of the
Hindu publications of the year." The writer of the <i>Report</i> is a
Hindu gentleman. The <i>Report of the Census of India</i>, 1901, declares
that "the influence of Christian teaching is ... far reaching, and that
there are many whose acts and opinions have been greatly modified
thereby." After these statements from secular and official writers, we may
refrain from quoting from Mission authorities more than the statement of
the Decennial Conference of representative missionaries from all India in
1902. The statement refers to South India. "<!-- Page 107 --><a name=
"Page_107" id="Page_107" />Christianity," we are told, "is in the air. The
higher classes are assimilating its ideas."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id=
"FNanchor_48_48" /><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Thus from East and North and South, from officials and non-officials, from
Europeans and natives, comes concurrent testimony. There is no declared
Reformation, but Christian and Western religious ideas are leavening
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variety of religious ideas in India.</div>

<p>To the student of Comparative Religion, or of Christianity, or of the
general progress of nations, that testimony from India is particularly
interesting. To the student of Comparative Religion, India presents a
particularly attractive field. Not hidden away in sacred classics or in
the records of travellers, but as elements of existing religions,
professed by men around, are illustrations of most of the types of
religious thought and practice. There are the pantheism of certain Hindu
ascetics, the polytheism of the masses, the animism of aboriginal races,
and the varieties of theism of Christians, Mahomedans, and the new Hindus
respectively. There are the curious phenomena of goddesses as well as
gods, and of distinctive features in the character and worship of the
female deities. There is the whole scale of worship up from bloody
sacrifices and self-tortures and from worship where <!-- Page 108 --><a
name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />the priest is everything, to worship like
that of Mahomedans and of Protestant Christians, where a mediatory
priesthood is virtually repudiated. There is the stage, still farther
beyond, at which the worshipper is supposed to be able to say of himself
"I am God." Of the first and last stages, India may be called the special
fields, for probably nowhere else in the world are so many animals killed
in sacrifice as at the temple of Kalighat in Calcutta; and the last stage,
as an observable religious phenomenon, is peculiar to India. In India
there is presented to us salvation in the attainment of an eternal
existence along with God, as among Christians and Mahomedans and many of
the less educated Hindus; and there is salvation in deliverance from
further lives, as among those Hindus who hold the doctrine of
transmigration. In India all these varieties of religious thought and
practice are actual, perceptible phenomena, ready for first-hand
observation by the student of Comparative Religion. But still more
interesting to him is that they are there in mutual contact, and telling
upon each other. For in the sphere of human beliefs, the student is much
more than an outside observer and classifier. He has his own conception of
truth, and is interested in observing how far in each case
<!-- Page 109 --><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />there is a convergence
towards truth or a divergence from it. In the sphere of human beliefs he
holds further, that, given opportunity, the nearer to truth the greater
certainty of survival. Given opportunity, as already postulated, the law
of beliefs is the survival of the truest. Truth will prevail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dynamical elements of Christianity.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dynamical doctrines in other spheres</div>

<p>To the student of Christianity, again, that same concurrent testimony
is profoundly interesting. Certain Christian ideas are being assimilated
in India. Certain cardinal aspects of Christianity are proving themselves
possessed of inherent force and attractiveness. They are showing that they
possess force not from authority, or tradition, or as part of a system of
doctrine, or as racially fitting, but when presented in new and often very
unfavourable surroundings. Borrowing an expression from physical science,
certain elements of Christianity are proving <i>themselves dynamical</i>.
For in non-Christian India, ecclesiastical authority or tradition and the
system of Christian doctrine as such, possess no force. By illustrations
from other spheres, let us make clear what is meant by such dynamical
elements of Christianity. The doctrine of the Origin of Species by means
of Natural Selection was put before the world by <!-- Page 110 --><a name=
"Page_110" id="Page_110" />Darwin in 1859, and within the half century has
been accepted almost as an axiom by the whole civilised world. Undoubtedly
that doctrine has proved itself dynamical. On the other hand, a few years
earlier than the publication of <i>The Origin of Species</i>, another body
of new doctrine was propounded to Britain and the world, and strongly
urged by its upholders, namely, the doctrine of Free Trade&mdash;the
advantage to the community of buying in the cheapest market. True or
false, that body of doctrine has not proved dynamical among the nations,
for the great majority of peoples still repudiate the doctrines of Free
Trade. Similarly certain elements of Christianity are commending
themselves to new India, and certain others are failing to do so at this
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrations from the history of
Christianity.</div>

<p>From century to century these dynamical elements of Christianity may
vary; and it is profoundly interesting to the student of the history of
religious beliefs to observe the variation. In the early apostolic times,
when the apostles and disciples were "scattered abroad," we see plainly in
the Acts of the Apostles that the dynamical element of Christianity is the
Resurrection of Our Lord. It is that which tells, and His coming
reign&mdash;with Jewish audiences in particular. It <!-- Page 111 --><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />was, <i>e.g.</i>, the manifestation of
Christ to St. Paul on his way to Damascus that completed the conversion of
his life. And so, repeatedly throughout the record of the Acts of the
Apostles, they are described as witness&mdash;bearers of the resurrection
to the outside world. [Greek: Megal&ecirc; dynamei], "<i>with great
power</i> gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus; and great grace was upon them all."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id=
"FNanchor_49_49" /><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And
yet&mdash;dynamical elements vary&mdash;in the different atmosphere of
Athens (we are twice told in so many words) this same resurrection of
Christ dug a gulf between St. Paul and the Athenians.<a name=
"FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50" /><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a> Passing to a very different period, the latter half of
the eighteenth century, the period of the rise of Methodism and the
revival of religion in England, the period of new interest in the inmates
of prisons, of agitation for the abolition of slavery, of the foundation
of all the great missionary societies, the period of the French Revolution
and the demand at home for extension of the franchise, all outcome of the
same inspiration,&mdash;what was the strong epidemic thought? Reading the
religious history of the time, we feel that the power that passed from
soul to soul was a tremulously intense realisation of the family of God
<!-- Page 112 --><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />and the love of God
for men, represented in Christ's voluntary death upon the cross, love for
the neglected and the enslaved in their sins and their sorrows. And again
in our own day, when we are tempted to say that the consciousness of God
and the eternal, the primary religious instincts, are fading, what by
common consent is really dynamical among educated men? Assuredly not the
shibboleths of High or Low Church. It is the person of Jesus Christ that
is dynamical; what He was on earth, what He has been ever since in the
hearts of individuals and in the Church. In a real sense we are starting
again from and with Himself. Anticipating, let us say that these two
elements most recently dynamical in Britain have had force likewise in
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">India a new touch-stone of Christianity.</div>

<p>India in the nineteenth century has been indeed a new touchstone to the
Christian religion; and, in brief, to make plain how far Christianity has
proved its force and its fitness to survive will occupy the remaining
chapters of this book. What has been the nature and extent of the impact
of Christian and modern thought upon India, and particularly upon
Hinduism? Of course I am thinking particularly of the educated native
Hindu community that has sprung up during the century just closed. The
<!-- Page 113 --><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" />dynamic of
Christianity, which it is our task to test, implies a measure of conscious
and intelligent approval. Japan is another such testing ground. Indeed the
only large fields where Christianity is presented to bodies of
non-Christian men able to yield approval or refuse it on intelligent
grounds, of which they are conscious, are India and Japan. In China also
there are no doubt large bodies of literati, but as a class they have not
yet come into the modern world and into contact with Christianity. Even
down to the Boxer rising of 1900, the wall of conservative patriotism shut
off the literati in China from the outer civilisation and religions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indians themselves to be our witnesses.</div>

<p>Fortunately for students of India, her new literati are not merely in
touch with the modern world, but express their minds readily in public
meetings and in print. From themselves we shall chiefly quote in
justifying the statements that will be made regarding the former or the
modern religious opinions of India. To non-Christian or secular writers,
also, we shall chiefly go, that the bias may rather be against than for
the acknowledgment of change and progress. Our plan is to pronounce as
little as possible upon either the Christian or the Hindu positions. We
are observers of the religious ideas of modern India, and desire our
readers to <!-- Page 114 --><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />come into
touch with modern Indians and to see for themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obstacles to changes in religion.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Education strips new Indians of belief.</div>

<p>Truth is great and will prevail, but let us not under-estimate the
difficulties in the way of new opinions in India, where these do not
appeal to the natural desires for power or status or comfort. I have
already referred to the deep-rooted notion that Hinduism is of the soil of
India, and adherence to it bound up with the national honour. I refer to
it here again only to glance at a kindred notion, common among
Anglo-Indians, that the Indian religion is the outcome of Indian
environment, and is "consequently" the best religion for India. That
superficial fallacy, undoubtedly, alienates the sympathy of many
Anglo-Indians from religious and social progress in India. Thrice at least
did one of the most distinguished viceroys, when addressing native
audiences, advise them to stick to their own beliefs, using these or very
similar words. He was addressing Mahomedans at one place, Hindus at the
second place, and Buddhists at the third, and we leave his advice at one
place to contradict his advice at another. Certainly let us allow for
variation in local usage, and in subjective opinion, while we are
insisting on the universality and objectivity of truth. For
<!-- Page 115 --><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />in spite of new and
strange environment, in spite of that prevailing notion that religion is a
racial thing, of the natural disinclination to change, of modern
agnosticism and materialism when the old ideas do give way&mdash;in spite
of these things, some of the cardinal features of Christianity are
commending themselves to educated India. Far from religion being racial,
the recent religious evolution of India suggests that in respect of the
religious instinct and the religious faculty, mankind are one, not
divided. <i>A priori</i>, therefore, we might anticipate that the elements
of Christianity which have proved dynamical with new India will be the
same that have proved their dynamic with educated men at home. So far as
the situation in India has been created by the destructive influence of
modern education, and by what may be called the modern spirit, the same
influences are telling both in Europe and in India; they have come from
Europe to India. There is the same unwillingness to believe in the
supernatural, and the same demand that religion shall satisfy ethical and
utilitarian tests. One difference, however, we may note. The educated men
of India may not be living so entirely in the modern atmosphere as the men
of Europe and America; but in India the modern spirit finds
<!-- Page 116 --><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />usages and systems of
thought more inconsistent with modern ideas. As a consequence, where in
India the modern spirit <i>has</i> come, it has stripped men barer of
belief. Listen to the following curious conglomeration, showing the
influences at work, constructive and destructive. It is a passage from the
pamphlet already referred to, <i>The Future of India</i>; the author is
arguing for what he calls "practical recognition of the Fatherhood of
God"&mdash;one new positive idea. That idea he takes to mean that "God is
the Father of all nations and religions," and that <i>therefore</i> "it
does not matter much to what religion a man belongs, so far as the future
of his soul is concerned." Does not that signify that he himself is
stripped bare of belief? From which modern notion, that religion does not
matter much, he next argues that a man ought to deny himself the luxury
and "satisfaction of breaking his religious fetters," <i>i.e.</i> of
seceding from his own faith and joining another. He ought to stick to his
community, says this writer, and "have the satisfaction of working for the
elevation of his countrymen." There we have the new political
consciousness. The writer, it should be added, says some plain things
about the need of social reform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three dynamical elements of Christianity.</div>

<p><!-- Page 117 --><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />As proved by
observation in India, the dynamical elements of Christianity may be
briefly enumerated as follows. Monotheism, tending more and more to the
distinctively Christian idea of God, Our Father, is commending itself, and
being widely accepted. Secondly, in a remarkable degree, Jesus Christ
Himself is being recognised and receiving general homage. In a less
degree, and yet notably, the Christian conception of the Here and
Hereafter is commending itself to the minds of the new-educated Hindus. In
the new religious organisations also, the Christian manner of worship and
of public worship commends itself almost as a matter of course. In none of
these spheres am I describing the outcome of visible conflict or of any
loud controversy. Rather, Christianity brought close to the religious
instincts and the religious ideas of India has been like a great magnet
introduced among a number of kindred but non-magnetised bodies lying
loosely around. In the presence, simply, of these dynamical elements, or
in contact with them, Indian religious thought is becoming polarised.
Towards and away from the same great points, Indian religious thought is
setting. These dynamical elements of Christianity, and the illustration of
their power, will be considered in the following chapters.</p>

<p><!-- Page 118 --><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />Of the elements of
Christianity that have proved themselves dynamical, we may note the
natural order in which they have come. The order in which I have stated
them is the order in which they asserted themselves, first "God Our
Father," then "Jesus Christ Himself." First, of this world in which we
find ourselves, when our <i>minds</i> awake, we must have some satisfying
conception. The belief in one God, in Him for whom we can find no better
name than "Our Father," approved itself to awakened India, to the <i>
intellectually</i> enlightened, and in the first place to small groups of
enlightened men in the large towns, the centres of modern education and
Christian influence. Then came an advance of a different nature
altogether. To those spiritually minded and more intense men who needed a
religious master, a hero, to whom their <i>hearts</i> might go out, there
came, after certain obstacles had been broken down, some knowledge of the
actual historical Jesus Christ. The first stage satisfied the <i>mind</i>
of modern educated India; the second stage concerns the highest affections
and the lives. We know the step, when in the Apostles' Creed we pass from
"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth," to the
<!-- Page 119 --><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />words "and in Jesus
Christ." Thereat we have brought theology down from heaven to earth; or
rather, in these days we would say, in Jesus Christ we have obtained on
earth, in actual history, in our affections, a foundation on which to rear
our system of actual and motive-giving belief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two physical changes on the face of a country.</div>

<p>When we consider how the face of a country has been altered during the
lapse of time, two great changes may be noticed, both of them due to the
action of man. First we may observe that the whole general character of
the country has undergone transformation. Gone are the ancient forests of
Scotland, which of old in many districts clad the whole countryside, and
with them have gone the wild animals which they sheltered. The forests
destroyed, and the rainfall in consequence less abundant, the surface
marshes and lakes have in many places vanished, taking the old agues and
fevers in their train. Instead of the strongholds of chieftains in their
fastnesses, surrounded by bands <!-- Page 121 --><a name="Page_121" id=
"Page_121" />of their clansmen and retainers, has come the sober,
peaceful, life of independent tenants, agricultural or artisan. And so on,
down through the general changes wrought on the face of a land by modern
conditions of life, we might watch the evolution of new features of the
landscape. But we turn to the other kind of change, which is more
noticeable at first sight, and is more directly due to the action of man.
Great, laboriously cultivated, fields now stretch where formerly there was
only waste or forest, or at best small sparsely scattered patches; and the
very products of the soil in these new spacious fields are in many cases
new. Where, for example, even in Britain before the close of the
seventeenth century, were the great fields of potatoes and turnips and red
clover, and even of wheat, which now meet the eye everywhere as the
seasons return? Where in India before the British period were the vast
areas now under tea and coffee, jute and cotton, although the two last
have been grown and manufactured in India from time immemorial? "It might
almost be said that, from Calcutta to Lahore, 50 per cent. of the
prevalent vegetation, cultivated and wild, has been imported into India
within historic times."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51" /><a
href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two similar changes in the religious thought of
India.</div>

<p><!-- Page 122 --><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />All that, of
course, is a parable. Likewise, in the new India we are studying, product
of new modern influences direct and indirect, two kinds of religious
changes impress us. There is, first, the gradual change coming over the
whole thought of the people, a transformation like that wrought upon the
face and climate of many lands. There is, further, the religious change,
more immediately evident, in the new Indian religious organisations of the
past century, analogous to the new, cultivated, products of the soil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Four new religious organisations.</div>

<p>As change more definite and perceptible, we look first at the new
Indian religious organisations. Within the British period, four organised
religious movements attract our notice. They are: I. The new Indian
Christian Church; II. The Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j and the kindred
Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes; III. The &#256;rya Sam&#257;j; and IV.
The Theosophical Society, which in India now stands for the revival of
Hinduism.</p>

<p>I. To hear the native Indian Church reckoned among the products of the
British period may be surprising to some. There are indeed Christian
communities in India older than the Christianity of many districts in
Britain, and even excluding the Syrian and Roman Christians of India we
must <!-- Page 123 --><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />acknowledge that
the Protestant Christian community dates farther back than the British
period. Yet in a real sense the Protestant Indian Church, and the
progressive character of the whole Indian Church, belong to the century
just closed. The Moravians and one English Missionary Society excepted,
all the great Missionary Societies now at work have come into being since
1793. In 1901 the native <i>Protestant</i> community in India, outcome of
these Societies' labours, numbered close upon a million souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Indian Church.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Indian Church and the national
consciousness.</div>

<p>The Indian Christian Church is a living organisation, or congeries of
organisations, over two and a half million souls all told, and growing
rapidly. The exact figures in 1901 were 2,664,313, showing an increase
during ten years of 30.8 per cent. The figures exclude Eurasians and
Europeans; and in Anglo-Indian speech, we may remark, all Americans and
Australians and South African whites and the like are Europeans. The
attitude of the Indian Christian Church to the new ideas introduced by the
British connection and by the modern world can readily be understood. Cut
off, cast off, by their fellow-countrymen, and brought into closer contact
than any others with Europeans in their missionaries and teachers, their
<!-- Page 124 --><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />minds have been open
to all the new ideas. We know in fact that Indian Christians are often
charged, by persons who do not appreciate the situation, with being
over-Europeanised. It may be so in certain ways, but, irrespective of
Christianity or Hinduism, the adoption of European ways results from
contact with Europeans, and in certain respects is almost a condition of
intercourse with Europeans. Let those, for example, who talk glibly about
Indians sticking to their own dress, know that gentlemen in actual native
dress are not allowed to walk on that side of the bandstand promenade in
Calcutta where Europeans sit&mdash;a scandal crying for removal. With
regard to the new national consciousness, it may be repeated that the
Indian Christian community is almost as alive with the national feeling as
the educated Hindu community. As the Indian Church becomes at once more
indigenous and more thoroughly educated in Western learning, as it becomes
less identified with European denominations, and less dependent upon
stimulus from without, it will no doubt become still more national in
every sense, be more recognised as one of India's institutions, and become
a powerful educator in India. Once within the environment of the national
feeling, the seed of <!-- Page 125 --><a name="Page_125" id=
"Page_125" />Christian thought and modern ideas will spring up and
spontaneously flourish. The future progress of the Indian Church may be
said to depend upon the growth of that national consciousness within it.
The sense of independence and the duty of self-support and union are,
properly, being fostered in the native churches. But one of the dangers
ahead undoubtedly is that, like one of the other religious movements of
the past century, or like the Ethiopian Church in South Africa, the Indian
Church may become infected with the political rather than the religious
aspect of the idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rammohan Roy.</div>

<p>II. <i>The Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j</i>.&mdash;Next to the Christian
Church in order of birth of the issue of the new age, comes the
Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j or Theistic Association. It was founded in Calcutta
in 1828 by the famous reformer, Raja Rammohan Roy, first of modern
Indians. The Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j is confessedly the outcome of contact
with Christian ideas. By the best known of the Br&#257;hma community, the
late Keshub Chunder Sen, it was described as "the legitimate offspring of
the wedlock of Christianity with the faith of the Hindu Aryans." "No other
reformation" [in India], says the late Sir M. Monier Williams, "has
<!-- Page 126 --><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />resulted in the same
way from the influence of European education and Christian ideas." The
founder himself, Raja Rammohan Roy, was indeed more a Christian than
anything else, although he wore his brahman thread to the day of his death
in order to retain the succession to his property for his son. In London
and in Bristol, where he died in 1833, he associated himself with Dr.
Carpenter and the more orthodox section of the Unitarians, explicitly
avowing his belief in the miracles of Christ generally, and particularly
in the resurrection. In Calcutta, indeed, the origin of the Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j was acknowledged at its commencement. After attending the
Scotch and other Churches in Calcutta, and then the Unitarian Church,
Rammohan Roy and his native friends set up a Church of their own, and one
name for it among educated natives was simply the Hindu Unitarian Church.
It is a secondary matter that, to begin with, the reformer believed that
he had found his monotheism in the Hindu Scriptures, now known to all
students as the special Scriptures of pantheism.</p>

<p>Raja Rammohan Roy, the brave man who made a voyage to Britain in
defiance of caste, the champion of the widow who had often been
<!-- Page 127 --><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />virtually obliged to
lay herself on her dead husband's pyre, the strenuous advocate of English
education for Indians, the supporter of the claim of Indians to a larger
employment in the public service, has not yet received from New India the
recognition and honour which he deserves. To every girl, at least in
Bengal, the province of widow-burning, he ought to be a hero as the first
great Indian knight who rode out to deliver the widows from the torturing
fire of Suttee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Service of the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j to
India.</div>

<p>As its theistic name implies, the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j professedly
represents a movement towards theism, <i>i.e.</i> a rise from the
polytheism and idolatry of the masses and a rejection of the pantheism of
Hindu philosophy. Of course, noteworthy though it be, the foundation of
the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j in 1828 was not the introduction of monotheism
to India. In the Indian Christian Church and in Mahomedanism, the
<!-- Page 128 --><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />doctrine of one,
personal, God had been set forth to India, and in one of the ancient Hindu
philosophical systems, the Yoga Philosophy, the same doctrine is implied.
But in India, Christianity and Mahomedanism were associated with hostile
camps; the Yoga Philosophy was known only to a few Sanscrit scholars. In
Br&#257;hmaism, the doctrine of one personal God became again natural
naturalised in India. That has been its special service to India, to
naturalise monotheism and many social and religious movements. For in
India, things new and foreign lie under a peculiar suspicion. In the
social sphere, the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j repudiates caste and gives to
women a position in society. As Indian <i>theists</i> also, when their
first church was opened in 1830, they gave the Indian sanction to
congregational worship and prayer, "before unknown to Hindus." For, the
brahman interposing between God and the ignorant multitude, the Hindu
multitude do not assemble themselves for united prayer, as Christians and
Mahomedans do; and at the other end of the Hindu scale, the professed
pantheist as such cannot pray. In proof of the latter statement, we recall
the words of Swami Vivekananda, representative of Hinduism in the
Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, in a lecture "The Real and the
Apparent Man," published in 1896. "It is the greatest of all lies," he
writes somewhat baldly, although one is often grateful for a bald,
definite statement, "that we are mere men; we are the God of the
Universe.... The worst lie that you ever told yourself is that you were
born a sinner.... The <!-- Page 129 --><a name="Page_129" id=
"Page_129" />wicked see this universe as a hell, and the partially good
see it as heaven, and the perfect beings realise it as God Himself.... By
mistake we think that we are impure, that we are limited, that we are
separate. The real man is the One Unit Existence." Prayer is therefore
irrational for a pantheist, for no man is separate from God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its limited membership.</div>

<p>The influence of the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j has been far greater than
its numerical success. Reckoned by its small company of 4050 members,<a
name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52" /><a href="#Footnote_52_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> some of them certainly men of the highest
culture and of sincere devoutness, the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j is a limited
and local movement, limited largely to the province of Bengal, and even to
a few of the larger towns in the province. But if the taint of the
intellectual origin of the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j be still visible in the
eclecticism that it professes, in its rejection of the supernatural, and
in its poor numerical progress, it has nevertheless done great things for
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j and the national
feeling.</div>

<p>As yet the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j has remained unaffected by the
political aspect of the new national feeling. Early in its history there
was, indeed, a section of the Sam&#257;j resolved to limit the
<!-- Page 130 --><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />selection of
scriptures to the scriptures of the Hindus, but the late Keshub Chunder
Sen successfully asserted the freedom of the Sam&#257;j, and probably
saved it from the narrow patriotic groove and from the political character
of the third of the new religious organisations, the &#256;rya
Sam&#257;j.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes or Prayer
Associations of S.W. India.</div>

<p><i>The Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes</i> or Prayer Associations of
South-Western India.&mdash;The history of India is pre-eminently the
history of Northern India, that is of the great plains of the Ganges and
the Punjab. One may test it by the simple academical test of reckoning
what percentage of marks in an examination on Indian history is assigned
to the events of the great northern plains. It is the same in the more
recent religious history of India. The southern provinces of Bombay and
Madras have contributed very little in respect of new religious life,
organised or unorganised, compared with the northern provinces of Bengal,
the United Provinces, and the Punjab. The Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes
or Prayer Associations of Bombay and South-western India are monotheistic
like the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j, and have their halls for their own
worship. But socially they have not severed themselves from their Hindu
brethren, and do not figure in <!-- Page 131 --><a name="Page_131" id=
"Page_131" />the Census as separate. Even compared with the Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j, they are few in number. The first Pr&#257;rthan&#257;
Sam&#257;j was founded in Bombay in 1867. In Madras there is a small
representation of the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j.</p>

<br />


<div class="sidenote">The &#256;rya Sam&#257;j.</div>

<p>III. <i>The &#256;rya Sam&#257;j</i> or <i>Vedic Theistic
Association</i>&mdash;In contrast to the Sam&#257;jes which are leavening
the country but themselves are numerically unprogressive, are two other
organisations&mdash;first, the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j of the United
Provinces and the Punjab, and secondly, the Theosophists, who are now most
active in Upper India, with Benares the metropolis of Hinduism, as their
headquarters. These two have taken hold of educated India as no other
movements yet have done. They appeal directly to patriotic pride and the
new national feeling, or, more truly, are primarily shaped thereby.</p>

<p>Founded in 1875, the &#256;ryas are the most rapidly increasing of the
new Indian sects. In 1901 they numbered 92,419, an increase in the decade
of 131 per cent. What ideas have such an attraction for
<!-- Page 133 --><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" />the educated middle
class, for to that class the &#256;ryas almost exclusively belong? In
certain parts of the United Provinces and the Punjab, it seems as much a
matter of course that one who has received a modern education should be an
&#256;rya, as that in certain other provinces he should be a supporter of
the Congress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation ideas of the &#256;ryas&mdash;two.</div>

<p>The prime motive ideas are two. One is the result of modern education
and of Christian influence, namely, a consciousness that in certain
grosser aspects, such as polytheism, idolatry, animal sacrifices, caste,
and the seclusion of women, the present-day Hinduism cannot be defended.
Those things the &#256;ryas repudiate,&mdash;all honour to them for their
protest in behalf of reason, although in respect of caste and the
seclusion of women, their theory is said to be considerably ahead of their
practice. In the same modern spirit every &#256;rya member pledges himself
to endeavour to diffuse knowledge; and a college and a number of schools
are carried on by &#256;ryas in the Punjab. Repudiating all those current
customs, of course the &#256;ryas have parted company with the orthodox
Hindus. &#256;rya preachers denounce the corruptions of Hinduism, and in
turn, what may be called a Great Council of orthodox Hindus has pronounced
<!-- Page 134 --><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />condemnation on the
&#256;ryas. At an assembly of about four hundred Hindu pandits, held in
1881 in the Senate House of the University in Calcutta, the views of the
founder of the &#256;ryas, Dyanand Saraswati, were condemned as
heterodox.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53" /><a href=
"#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The second motive idea is the new national consciousness, the new
patriotic feeling of Indians. The patriotic feeling is manifest in the
name; the &#256;ryas identify themselves with the &#256;ryans, the
Indo-European invaders of India, from whom the higher castes of Hindus
claim to be descended. Virtually, we may say, the &#256;ryas claim by
their name to be the pure original Hindus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infallibility of the Vedas the leading tenet at
first.</div>

<p>To the first influence we may assign one of the chief doctrines of the
&#256;ryas, namely, their monotheism. Others of their doctrines belong to
the theology and philosophy of Hinduism, <i>e.g.</i> the ancient doctrine
of the transmigration of souls, and the doctrine of the three eternal
entities, God, the Soul, and Matter, the doctrinal significance of which
we shall have occasion to consider hereafter. These three uncreated
existences constitute one of the doctrines of the Joga system of Hindu
philosophy. To the second, or patriotic, influence, we may assign
especially the fundamental tenet of the founder <!-- Page 135 --><a name=
"Page_135" id="Page_135" />of the &#256;ryas, namely, the infallibility of
the original Scriptures, the four Vedas, given, as he alleged, to Indian
sages at the creation of the world. "Back to the Vedas!" we may say, is
the cry of the &#256;ryas. In effect, the cry is tantamount to the plea
that the errors of Hinduism are only later accretions; and be it
acknowledged that no sanction can be drawn from the Vedas for the
prohibition of widow marriages, for the general prevalence of child
marriages, for the tyranny of caste, for idolatry and several other
objectionable customs.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54" /><a
href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Among the &#256;ryas,
therefore, we have the championship of things Indian in its crudest form.
Ludicrous are the attempts to rationalise all the statements of the Vedas,
and to find in them all modern science and modern ideas, pouring new wine
into old wine-skins, in perfect innocence of "the higher criticism." Thus
while animal sacrifices are proscribed by the &#256;ryas, they are
everywhere assumed in the Vedas, and two of the hymns in the Rigveda are
for use at the sacrifice of a horse (a[s']wamedha).<a name=
"FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55" /><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a> According to an &#256;rya commentator, however,
a[s']wamedha is to be translated not "sacrifice of a horse," but
destruction of ignorance,&mdash;sacrifice of <!-- Page 136 --><a name=
"Page_136" id="Page_136" />an ass, as one may jestingly say.<a name=
"FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56" /><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class=
"fnanchor">[56]</a> Offerings for deceased parents, prescribed in detail
in the Vedas, are similarly rationalised into kind treatment of parents in
old age. The ancient and modern condemnation of eating beef was
rationalised by the &#256;ryas as follows: To kill a cow is as bad as to
kill many men. For suppose a cow to have a lifetime of fourteen or fifteen
years. Her calves, let us say, would be six cow calves and six bull
calves. The milk of the cow and her six cow calves during her natural
lifetime would give food for a day to an army of 154,440 men, according to
the calculation of the founder of the &#256;ryas, while the labour of the
other six calves as oxen would give a full meal to an army of 256,000 men.
Therefore to kill a cow, etc., Q.E.D. Modern democracy, the Copernican
system of astronomy, a knowledge of the American continent, of steamships,
and of the telegraph are all discovered by Dyanand in the Vedas, as no
doubt wireless telegraphy and radium would have been, had death not cut
short, in 1883, the discoveries of the founder of the &#256;ryas.<a name=
"FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57" /><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class=
"fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 137 --><a name="Page_137" id=
"Page_137" />The modern leaven still affecting the &#256;ryas.</div>

<p>These specimens of &#256;rya exposition of the Vedas I have given with
no intention of scoffing, although we may be permitted a laugh. I desire
to show the conflict of modern ideas and the new patriotic feeling, and
how the latter has affected the religious and theological position of the
&#256;ryas. It is the prominence of the patriotic feeling in many branches
of the Sam&#257;j that has led some observers to describe it as less of a
religious than a political organisation, anti-British and anti-Mahomedan
and anti-Christian. But the opponents of the Sam&#257;j are always
associated by &#256;ryas with rival religions; <i>keranis, kuranis,</i>
and <i>puranis</i> is their echoing list of their opponents,&mdash;namely,
Christians <i>(kerani</i> being a corruption of <i>Christiani</i>), and
believers in the Koran, and believers in the Purans, <i>i.e.</i> the later
Hindu books. And that there is much more than political feeling is
apparent in their latest developments. The leaven of modern ideas has now
led to the rise of a party among the &#256;ryas which is prepared to stand
by reason out and out, and repudiate the founder's bondage to the Vedas
and his <i>&agrave; priori</i> expositions. Popularly, the new party is
known as the "flesh-eaters." At present the Sam&#257;j is about equally
divided, but the more rationalistic section comprises most of the
new-educated members. <!-- Page 138 --><a name="Page_138" id=
"Page_138" />Should the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j retain, as their chief
doctrinal positions, the perfection of pure original Hinduism and
opposition to every other ism, no great foresight or historical knowledge
is required to predict for the &#256;ryas, despite their vigour, a speedy
lapse from their reforming zeal into the position simply of a new Hindu
caste, reverting gradually to type. Their fate is still in the
balance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bombay &#256;rya Sam&#257;j.</div>

<p>The &#256;rya Sam&#257;j in Bombay does not repudiate caste. One of
their principles is that no member is expected to violate any of his own
special caste rules. Why, one cannot help asking, this invertebrate
character of the new Indian religious associations in Western India? It is
patent that what the Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes of Western India are
to the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j of Bengal, the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j in
Bombay is to that in the Punjab and the United Provinces&mdash;only feeble
echoes. Bombay Indians lead their countrymen in commercial enterprise, and
in political questions they take as keen an interest as any of the Indian
races. With hesitation and with apologies to Parsee friends, we ask
whether it is the numerous Parsees in Bombay who have made their
fellow-westerns only worldly-wise. For to great commercial enterprise, the
Parsees add a stubborn conservatism in religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Theosophical Society and the national
feeling.</div>

<p><!-- Page 139 --><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />IV. <i>The
Theosophists</i> are the only other new religious organisation whom we can
notice.&mdash;Them too the new patriotic feeling has very largely shaped.
Founded in America in 1875, the very year in which the &#256;rya
Sam&#257;j was established in Bombay, the Theosophical Society professed
to be "the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood of Humanity," representing
and excluding no religious creed and interfering with no man's caste. On
the other hand, somewhat inconsistently, it professed to be a society to
promote the study of &#256;ryan and other Eastern literature, religion,
and sciences, and to vindicate their importance; and it appealed for
support, amongst others, "to all who loved India and would see a revival
of her ancient glories, intellectual and spiritual." At the same time the
society professed "to investigate the hidden mysteries of nature and the
psychical powers latent in man." The society naturally gravitated towards
India, and by 1884 had 87 branches in India and Ceylon, against 12 in all
the rest of the world. Its career might easily have been predicted.
Inevitably, when transplanted to India, about the year 1878, such a
society came under the spell of the new national consciousness already
referred to. For a time Theosophy shared with the political Congress the
first place in the interest of <!-- Page 140 --><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140" />New India, and crowds of educated Indians still assemble
whenever Mrs. Besant, now the leading Theosophist, is to speak. One of the
rules of the society, however, saved it from the descent into politics
that has overtaken the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j and tainted it as a religious
movement. Rule XVI (1884) forbids members, as such, to interfere in
politics, and declares expulsion to be the penalty for violation of the
rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&#256;rya period of the Theosophical Society.</div>

<p>Consistently enough, when the society was transplanted to India, it
entered into partnership with the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j; for two years,
indeed, Madame Blavatsky, the first leader of the Theosophists, had been
corresponding from America with the founder of the &#256;ryas. The
&#256;rya tenet of the infallibility of the original Hindu Scriptures
needed no reconciliation with the Theosophist declaration of the ancient
spiritual glories of India. But the &#256;ryas are also religious
reformers, while, as enlightened Hindus now complain, the Theosophists are
more Hindu than the Hindus. After three years, in 1881, difference arose
on the question of the personality of God. The &#256;ryas, we have seen,
are monotheist; the Theosophical Society, we shall see, is identified with
brahmanical pantheism.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58" /><a

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 141 --><a name="Page_141" id=
"Page_141" />Buddhist period of the Theosophical Society.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Pro-Hindu period of the Theosophical Society.</div>

<p>The Buddhist period of the Theosophical Society, which came next, is
best known to general readers, but is only an episode in its history. In
the early "eighties," we find the society pro-Buddhist, and apparently
identifying <i>Buddhism</i> with "the ancient glories of India, spiritual
and intellectual," that the society was professedly desirous to revive. We
associate the period with the publication of <i>Esoteric Buddhism</i>, by
Mr. A.P. Sinnett, one of the society's leaders, and with Madame
Blavatsky's claim to be in spiritual communication with Mahatmas [great
spirits] in Thibet, the Buddhist land, now robbed of its mystery by the
British expedition of 1904. Madame Blavatsky claimed to be receiving
letters carried straight from Thibet by some air-borne Ariel. The
discovery in 1884 of Madame Blavatsky's trickery ended the exhibition of
"psychical powers," and also apparently the Buddhist period of the
society. That the society itself survived the exposure is proof that it
had a deeper root than any mere cult of Buddhism or Spiritualism could
give. Its appeal, as we have said, was to the new patriotic feeling in the
sphere of religion. To Madame Blavatsky succeeded Mrs. Besant as leading
spirit, and to the cult of Buddhism again succeeded the
<!-- Page 142 --><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />glorification of
ancient Hinduism and now also apologies of Hinduism as it is; and to
Madras as chief centre of Theosophy succeeded Benares, metropolis of
Hinduism. Mrs. Besant proclaimed herself the reincarnation of some ancient
Hindu pandit, and called upon Hindus to devote themselves to the study of
the Sacred Sanscrit. Supported by many well-to-do Hindus, in 1900 she
founded a college at Benares in which Hinduism might be lived and
inculcated as Christianity is inculcated in the Indian Missionary
Colleges. In the beginning of 1904 a great figure of the goddess
Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of Learning, was being erected in the grounds
of the College. The subordination of the Indian Theosophical Society, at
least in the person of Mrs. Besant, to the pro-Hindu national movement may
be pronounced complete. In the sphere of religion, this new Indian
consciousness which has enveloped the Theosophists is a force opposed to
change and reform. The Theosophical Society, which at the outset professed
to be the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood, is now fostering caste and
Hindu exclusiveness, the antitheses of the idea of humanity. Yet, as we
shall see, even in the text-books of Hindu Religion prepared for use in
the Hindu College, Benares, <!-- Page 143 --><a name="Page_143" id=
"Page_143" />Christian thought is not difficult to discover. And its meed
of praise must not be withheld from the attempts of Theosophists and the
Hindu College, Benares, to rationalise current Hindu customs and to reduce
the chaos of Hindu beliefs to some system that will satisfy New India.
Fain would the Theosophists propound, as we have already noted in the
chapter, "New Social Ideas," that caste should be determined by character
and occupation, not by birth. That being impossible, they would fain see
the myriad of castes reduced to the original four named in Manu. To quote
again the summing up regarding the caste system in the chief Hindu
text-book referred to&mdash;"Unless the abuses which are interwoven with
caste can be eliminated, its doom is certain." That is much from the
leaders of the Hindu reaction. In Hinduism they may often see only what
they wish to see, but they are not wholly blinded.</p>

<p>The Theosophists, it should be noted, do not figure as such in the
Census. Indian Christians, Brahmas, and &#256;ryas have all taken up a
definite new position in respect of religion, and ticket themselves as
such; the Theosophists are now at least mainly the apologists of things as
they are, and require no name to differentiate themselves.</p>

<h3>THE NEW MAHOMEDANS</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The national anti-British feeling not manifested
among Mahomedans.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomedan religious movements.</div>

<p>The Mahomedans, the other great religious community of India,<a name=
"FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59" /><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class=
"fnanchor">[59]</a> have been far less stirred by the new era than the
Hindus, whom hitherto we have been chiefly considering. Only a small
number of Mahomedans belong to the professional class, so that modern
education and the awakening have not reached Mahomedans in the same degree
as Hindus. Quite outnumbered also by Hindus, they identify themselves
politically with the British rather than with the Hindus, so that as a
body they do not support the Congress, the great Indian Political
Association, and have no anti-British consciousness. Mahomedan solidarity
is strong enough, but it is religious not national, and so it is only in
the religious sphere that we find the new era telling upon Mahomedans. Two
small religious movements may be noted curiously parallel to the &#256;rya
<!-- Page 145 --><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />and Br&#257;hma
movements among Hindus, and suggesting the operation of like
influences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wahabbi movement analogous to
&#256;ryaism.</div>

<p>As the &#256;ryas preach a return to the pure original Hinduism of the
Vedas, the first Mahomedan movement inculcates a return to the pure
original Mahomedanism of the Koran. In particular, it urges a casting off
of the Hindu customs and superstitions that the Indian converts to
Mahomedanism have frequently retained,&mdash;the offerings to the dead,
for example. In the first instance, the movement came from a seventeenth
century Arabian sect, the Wahabbis, but the movement reached India only
about the year 1820, and therefore is a feature of the period we are
surveying. The movement belongs specially to Bengal and the United
Provinces north-west of Bengal, and is known by a variety of local names,
Wahabbi and other. Significant, as supporting what has been said regarding
the absence of anti-British feeling among present-day Mahomedans, is the
fact that in the first stages of the Wahabbi movement, both in Eastern and
Western Bengal, the duty of war upon infidels&mdash;on the British and the
Hindus in this case&mdash;was a prominent doctrine of the crusade. In
Mahomedan language, India was <i>Daru-l-harb</i> or a Mansion of War. In
these <!-- Page 146 --><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />later years, on
the contrary, it is generally recognised by Mahomedans that India under
the British rule is not <i>Daru-l-harb</i>, but <i>Daru-l-Islam</i>, or a
Mansion of Islamism, in which war on infidels is not incumbent.<a name=
"FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60" /><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class=
"fnanchor">[60]</a> It may be noted that the decree, recently issued from
Mecca, that British territory is Daru-l-Islam, can only refer to
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Aligarh movement analogous to Brahmaism.</div>

<p>Exactly like the Brahmas, the other new Mahomedan sect, in the modern
rational spirit, have refined away their faith to a theism or deism purged
of the supernatural. Mahomed's inspiration and miracles are rejected.
These represent the modern rationalising spirit in religion; reason is
their standard, and "reason alone is a sufficient guide." According to Sir
Syed Ahmad, founder of the movement, "Islam is Nature, and Nature Islam."
Hence the sect is sometimes called the Naturis,<a name="FNanchor_61_61"
id="FNanchor_61_61" /><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
or followers of <i>Natural</i> Religion, the adoption of the English word
identifying them again with the Br&#257;hmas, who are essentially the
outcome of English education and Christian influence among Hindus. The
Naturis, the modernised Mahomedans, have as their headquarters the
<!-- Page 147 --><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" />Mahomedan
Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh in the United Provinces. It ought to be
said that they also claim to be going back to pure original Mahomedanism
before it was corrupted by the "Fathers" of Islam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Will the new religious organisations survive?</div>

<p>The four new religious organisations described in the preceding
chapters may or may not survive&mdash;who can tell? What would they
become, or what would become of them, in the event, say, of the great
nations of Europe issuing from some deadly conflict so balanced that India
and the East had to be let alone, entirely cut off? The Indian Christian
Church, hardly yet acclimatised so far as it is the creation of modern
efforts, would she survive? The English sweet-pea, sown in India, produced
its flowers, but not at first any vigorous self-propagating seed. The
Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j, graft of West on East, and still sterile as an
intellectual coterie, how would it fare, cut off from its Western nurture?
<!-- Page 149 --><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />The &#256;rya
Sam&#257;j&mdash;what, in that event, would be her resistance to the
centripetal force that we have noted in her blind patriotism? The
reactionary Theosophists&mdash;after the provocative action had
ceased&mdash;what of them? Would not the Indian jungle, which they are
trying to reduce to a well-ordered garden of indigenous fruits, speedily
lapse to jungle again? We shall not attempt to answer our own questions
directly, but proceed to the second part of our programme sketched on p.
122. How far then have Christian and modern religious ideas been <i>
naturalised</i> in New India, whether within the new religious
organisations or without? Whatever the fate of the organisations, these
naturalised ideas might be expected to survive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modification of doctrines.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Elements of Christianity being naturalised in
India&mdash;three.</div>

<p>We recall the statements made on ample authority in an earlier chapter,
that certain aspects of Christianity are attracting attention in India and
proving themselves possessed of inherent force and attractiveness. These,
the dynamical elements of Christianity, were specially the idea of God the
Father, the person of Jesus Christ, and the Christian conception of the
Here and Hereafter. For although Hinduism declares a social boycott
against any Hindu who transports his person over the sea to Europe, within
India itself the Hindu<!-- Page 150 --><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />
mind is in close contact with such modern religious ideas. The wall built
round the garden will not shut out the crows. Indeed, like the ancient
Athenian, the modern Hindu takes the keenest interest in new religious
ideas.</p>

<p>To comprehend the impression that such new religious ideas are making,
we must realise in some measure the background upon which they are cast,
both that part of it which the new ideas are superseding and the remainder
which constitutes their new setting and gives them their significance. In
brief, what is the present position of India in regard to religious
belief; and in particular, what are the prevailing beliefs about God?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian beliefs about God&mdash;Polytheists; Theists;
Pantheists.</div>

<p>A rough classification of the theological belief of the Hindus of the
present day would be&mdash;the multitude are polytheists; the new-educated
are monotheists; the brahmanically educated are professed pantheists.
Rough as it is, we must keep the classification before us in trying to
estimate the influence upon the Indian mind of the Christian idea of God.
From that fundamental classification let us try to understand the Hindu
position more fully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No one doctrine is distinctive of Hinduism.</div>

<p>Let it be realised, in the first place, how <i>undefined</i>
<!-- Page 151 --><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />is the Hindu's
religious position. From the rudest polytheism up to pantheism, and even
to an atheistic philosophy, all is within the Hindu pale, like fantastic
cloud shapes and vague mist and empty ether, all within the same sky. To
the student of Hinduism, then, the first fact that emerges is that there
are no distinctive Hindu doctrines. No one doctrine is distinctive of
Hinduism. There is no canonical book, nowhere any stated body of doctrine
that might be called the Hindu creed. The only common measure of Hindus is
that they employ brahmans in their religious ceremonies, and even that
does not hold universally. A saying of their own is, "On two main points
all sects agree&mdash;the sanctity of the cow and the depravity of women."
In contrast to Hindus in this respect of the absence of a standard creed,
Mahomedans call themselves <i>kitabi</i> or possessing a book, since in
the Koran they do possess such a canon. In the words of Mahomed,
Christians and Jews likewise are "the peoples of the book," and have a
defined theological position. But regarding Hindus, again, we note there
is no doctrinal pale, no orthodoxy or heterodoxy. "We Europeans," writes
Sir Alfred Lyall regarding Hinduism, "can scarcely comprehend an ancient
<!-- Page 152 --><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />religion, still alive
and powerful, which is a mere troubled sea without shore or visible
horizon."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62" /><a href=
"#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In these days of opportunist
denunciation of creeds, the amorphous state of creedless Hinduism may be
noted.</p>

<p>The experience of the late Dr. John Henry Barrows, President of the
Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893, may be quoted in confirmation
of the absence of a Hindu creed. After he had won the confidence of
India's representatives as their host at Chicago, and had secured for them
a unique audience there, being himself desirous to write on Hinduism, he
wrote to over a hundred prominent Hindus requesting each to indicate what
in his view were some of the leading tenets of Hinduism. He received only
one reply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pantheism, Maya, and Transmigration may be called
Hindu doctrines.</div>

<p>No one doctrine is distinctive of Hinduism. It is an extreme misleading
statement, nevertheless, to say as some Western writers have done, and at
least one Hindu writer,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63" /><a
href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> that Hinduism is not a
religion at all, but only a social system. There are several doctrines to
which a great many Hindus would at once conventionally subscribe, and
<!-- Page 153 --><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" />these I venture to
call Hindu doctrines. In theological conversations with Hindus, three
doctrines very frequently show themselves as a theological background.
These are, first, Pantheism; secondly, Transmigration and Final Absorption
into Deity; and, thirdly, Maya, i.e. Delusion, or the Unreality of the
phenomena of Sense and Consciousness. I find a recent pro-Hindu writer
making virtually the same selection. In the ninth century, she writes,
Sankarachargya, the great upholder of Pantheism, "took up and defined the
[now] current catch-words&mdash;maya, karma [the doctrine of works, or of
re-birth according to desert], reincarnation, and left the terminology of
Hinduism what it is to-day."... "But," she also adds, "they are nowhere
and in no sense regarded as essential."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id=
"FNanchor_64_64" /><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Naturally, then, the inquiry that we have set ourselves to will at the
same time be an inquiry how far Christian thought has affected these three
main Hindu doctrines of Pantheism, Transmigration, and Maya.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commingling of contradictory beliefs&mdash;</div>

<div class="sidenote">Polytheism with Monotheism.</div>

<p>Nor is it to be imagined that the Hindu polytheism, theism, and
pantheism are distinguishable religious strata. "Uniformity and
consistency of creeds are inventions of the European mind," says
<!-- Page 154 --><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" />a cynical writer
already quoted. "Hinduism bristles with contradictions, inconsistencies,
and surprises," says Sir M. Monier Williams. The common people are indeed
polytheists, at different seasons of the year and on different social
occasions worshipping different deities, male or female, and setting out
to this or that shrine, as the touts of the rival shrines have persuaded
them. Nevertheless, an intelligent member of the humbler ranks is always
ready to acknowledge that there is really only one God, of whom the
so-called gods are only variations in name. Or his theory may be that
there is one supreme God, under whom the popular deities are only
departmental heads; for the presence of the great central British
Government in India is a standing suggestion of monotheism. The officer
who drew up the <i>Report of the Census of India</i>, 1901 (p. 363) gives
an instance of this commingling of monotheism and polytheism. "An
orderly," he writes, "into whose belief I was inquiring, described the
relation between the supreme God and the Devata [minor Gods] as that
between an official and his orderlies, and another popular simile often
used is that of the Government and the district officer."<a name=
"FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65" /><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class=
"fnanchor">[65]</a> The <!-- Page 155 --><a name="Page_155" id=
"Page_155" />polytheism of the masses may thus blend with the theism which
is the ordinary intellectual standpoint of the educated classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monotheism with Polytheism.</div>

<p>Rising to the next stage, namely, the theism of the educated
class&mdash;the blending of their theism with the polytheism of the masses
is illustrated in the July number of the magazine of the Hindu College,
Benares, the headquarters of the late Hindu revival and of the pantheistic
philosophy. In answer to an inquirer's question&mdash;"Is there only one
God?" the reply is, "There is one supreme Lord or Ishvara of the universe,
and there are minor deities or devas who intelligently guide the various
processes of nature in their different departments in willing obedience to
Ishvara." The Hindu College, Benares, be it remembered, is primarily one
of the modern colleges whence the modern new-Indians come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monotheism with Pantheism.</div>

<p>Again, the modern theism of the educated, in like manner, very readily
passes into the pantheism of the philosophers and of those educated in
Sanscrit, which I have described as part of the accepted Hindu orthodoxy.
For, whatever its origin, an observer finds the pantheistic idea emerge
all over educated India. The late Sir M. Monier Williams speaks of
pantheism as a main root of the original <!-- Page 156 --><a name=
"Page_156" id="Page_156" />Indo-Aryan creed, which has "branched out into
an endless variety of polytheistic superstitions." Whether that be so, or
whether, as is now more generally believed, the polytheism is the
aboriginal Indian plant into which the pantheistic idea has been grafted
as communities have become brahmanised, the pantheistic idea very readily
presents itself to the mind of the educated Hindu. In any discussion
regarding human responsibility the idea crops up that <i>all</i> is God,
"There is One only, and no second." We can scarcely realise how readily it
comes to the middle-class Hindu's lips that God is all, and that there can
be no such thing as sin. The pantheists are thus no separate sect from the
theists, any more than the theists are from the polytheists. The same man,
if a member of the educated class, will be polytheist in his established
domestic religion, theist in his personal standpoint and general
profession, and probably a pantheist in a controversy regarding moral
responsibility, or should he set himself to write about religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration of polytheism, monotheism, and
pantheism commingling.</div>

<p>Take a statement of the mingling of polytheism, monotheism, and
pantheism from the extreme south of India, a thousand miles away from
Benares. "Though those men all affirmed," we read, "that there is only one
God, they admitted that they <!-- Page 157 --><a name="Page_157" id=
"Page_157" />each worshipped several. They saw nothing inconsistent in
this. Just as the air is in everything, so God is in everything, therefore
in the various symbols. And as our king has diverse representative
Viceroys and Governors to rule over his dominions in his name, so the
Supreme has these subdeities, less in power and only existing by force of
Himself, and He, being all pervasive, can be worshipped under their
forms."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66" /><a href=
"#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pure pantheism rare.</div>

<p>At the top of all is the pure pantheist, a believer in the illusion of
the senses, and generally though not always an ascetic. For life is not
worth living if it is merely an illusion, and the illusion must be
dispelled, and the world of the senses renounced. If "father and brother,
etc., have no actual entity," said the reformer Raja Rammohan Roy [1829]
when combating pantheism, "they consequently deserve no real affection,
and the sooner we escape from them and leave the world the better." So the
pantheist is generally an ascetic cut off from the world to be consistent
in his pantheism. Yet again, we repeat that such pure pantheists are very
rare, and that "in India forms of pantheism, theism, and polytheism are
ever interwoven with each other."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id=
"FNanchor_67_67" /><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 158 --><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />To one familiar
with India, such a medley is neither inconceivable nor improbable; the
debatable question only is, what sufficient account of the cause thereof
can be given. Why is it that Hindu doctrine has never set? Why this
incongruity between doctrine and domestic practice? Why this
double-mindedness in the same educated individual? Much might be said in
the endeavour to account for these characteristic features of India, the
despair of the Christian missionary. I confine myself to the bearing of
the question upon the influence of Christian ideas, and particularly of
Christian theism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fluidity of Hindu thought; rigidity of Hindu
practice.</div>

<p>For the student of this special aspect of Hinduism a second pertinent
fact here emerges, namely, that Hindu practice is much more established
than Hindu doctrine. The unchangeableness of Hindu ritual is not a new
idea; it is its bearing on doctrine that has not been clearly considered.
There <i>is</i>, then, a distinctly recognised Hindu orthodoxy in manners
and worship, at least for each Hindu community, while there is no
orthodoxy in doctrine. The broad distinctive marks of Hindu practice, we
may repeat, are the social usage of caste, and the employment of brahmans
in religious ritual. With ideas, then, thus fluid and practice thus
<!-- Page 159 --><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />rigid, it will be
easily understood that Christian and modern ideas have made much greater
headway in India than Christian customs and modes of worship. The mind of
educated India has been Christianised to a much greater extent than the
religious or domestic practices have been. Perhaps it might be said that
all down the centuries of Christian Church history, opinion has often been
in advance of worship and the social code, that social and religious
conventionalities have lagged behind belief. If so, it is the marked
conservatism in ceremonial that is noteworthy in India. While Hindu
beliefs are dissolving or dropping out of the mind, Hindu practices are
successfully resisting the solvent influences or only slowly being
transformed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More progress towards Christian thought than
Christian practice.</div>

<p>It is not too much to say that the educated Hindu does not regard a
fixed creed as a part of his Hinduism, but rather boasts of the doctrinal
comprehensiveness of his religion. He joyfully lives in a ferment of
religious thought, surrendering to the doctrine of a satisfying teacher,
but the idea of creed subscription, or a doctrinal stockade, is utterly
foreign to his nature. For him the standards are the fixed social usages
and the brahmanical ritual. Hear a Hindu himself on the matter, the
<!-- Page 160 --><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" /> historian of <i>Hindu
Civilisation during British Rule</i> [i. 60]: "Hinduism has ever been and
still is as liberal and tolerant in matters of religious belief as it is
illiberal and intolerant in matters of social conduct." In a recent
pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68" /><a href=
"#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> an Anglo-Indian civilian gives
his evidence clearly, if too baldly, of the fixity of practice and the
mobility of belief. "The educated Hindu," he writes, "has largely lost his
belief in the old myths about the gods and goddesses of the Hindu
pantheon, and has learned to smile at many of the superstitions of his
uneducated countrymen. But Hinduism as a religion that tells a man not
only what he shall eat, what he shall drink, and wherewithal he shall be
clothed, but tells him how to perform innumerable acts that men of other
nations never think have anything to do with religion at all, Hinduism as
an intricate social code, stands largely unaffected by the flood of
Western education that has been poured upon the country. He instances a
brahman, one of his own subordinates, college-bred and English-speaking,
who, when away from home with his superior officer, had to cook his food
for himself, because the brahman servant he had with him was of a
<!-- Page 161 --><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" />lower division than
his own, and he could not afford to hire a man of his own status among
brahmans."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thought independent of act.</div>

<p>We ask again for the cause of this progress in thought and stagnation
in practice. In India, creed and practice go their own way; thinking is
independent of acting. Listen to the naive standpoint assumed in the
Confession or Covenant of a Theistic Association established in Madras in
1864. We read in article 3 that the person being initiated makes this
declaration: "In the meantime, I shall observe the ceremonies now in use,
but only where indispensable. I shall go through such ceremonies, where
they are not conformable to pure Theism, as mere matters of routine,
destitute of all religious significance&mdash;as the lifeless remains of a
superstition which has passed away." And again in article 4: "I shall
never endeavour to deceive anyone as to my religious opinions." In the
revision of 1871, both articles were dropped, but in the earlier form
there was no attempt to disguise that thought was independent of act. The
familiar figure of Buddha in meditation, seated cross-legged and
motionless, with vacant introspective eyes, oblivious of the outer world,
is a type of the separation of thought from act that seems natural to
India or to the Indian mind, type <!-- Page 162 --><a name="Page_162" id=
"Page_162" />also of the independence of each thinker. The thinker
secludes himself; "the mind is its own place." To become a thinker
signifies to become an ascetic recluse; even modern enlightenment often
removes an Indian from fellow-feeling with his kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Theological Faculties.</div>

<p>How is it so? I say nothing of the climate of tropical India as a
contributory cause. The way in which Hindu learning was and is
transmitted, is itself almost sufficient explanation of the independence
and the fluidity of religious doctrine. Hinduism has no recognised
Theological Faculties as training schools for the priesthood. <i>
Buddhist</i> monasteries of the early Christian centuries we do read of,
institutions corresponding to our universities, to which crowds of
students resorted, and where many subjects were taught; but the <i>
Hindu</i> lore is transmitted otherwise. Beside or in his humble dwelling,
the learned Hindu pandit receives and teaches and shares his poverty with
his four, five, or it may be twenty disciples, who are to be the
depositaries of his lore, and in their turn its transmitters. Such an
institution is a Sanscrit tol, where ten to twenty years of the formative
period of a young pandit's life may be spent. Without printed books and
libraries and <!-- Page 163 --><a name="Page_163" id=
"Page_163" />intercourse with kindred minds, there may be as many schools
of thought as there are teachers. And all this study, be it remembered,
has no necessary connection with the priesthood. Tols have no necessary
connection with temples, or temples with tols. Hereditary priests are
independent of Theological Schools. Recently, indeed, in Bengal these tols
have been taken up by the Education Department, and their studies are
being directed to certain fixed subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The twofold priesthood&mdash;religious teachers and
celebrants.</div>

<div class="sidenote">How doctrine moves independently of ritual.</div>

<p>Another feature of the organisation of Hinduism, hitherto
insufficiently noticed, has a still closer connection with this freedom of
thought and fixity of practice. The Indian mind is open to new religious
ideas, while the religious customs of India remain almost unaffected, <i>
because</i> the priesthood of Hinduism is two-fold. One set of priests,
called purohits, are merely the celebrants at worship and ceremonies; the
second set, called gurus, theoretically more highly honoured, are or were
the religious teachers of the people. Among Mahomedans there is a somewhat
similar two-fold priesthood, although among them doctrine is not divorced
from religious worship and ritual. But in Christianity we have not
specialised so far. A Christian clergyman, as we know, holds both offices;
he is both <!-- Page 164 --><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />the
religious teacher and the celebrant at sacraments, etc. In Hinduism, with
these two sets of priests entirely separate, it is evident that a change
may take place in the creed without the due performance of the Hindu
ritual being affected. A striking instance of the divergence of guru from
purohit is given by Sir Monier Williams in another connection. In India,
he says, no temples are more common than those containing the symbol of
the God Siva&mdash;there are said to be thirty million symbols of Siva
scattered over India&mdash;yet among gurus there is scarcely one in a
hundred whose vocation is to impart the mantra (the saving text) of
Siva.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69" /><a href=
"#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It has already been explained
how the creed of Hinduism is dissolving while its practices remain; to
restate the fact otherwise now&mdash;The hereditary purohits continue to
be employed many times a year in a Hindu household, as worship, births,
deaths, marriages, and social ceremonies recur, but the hereditary gurus
as religious teachers have become practically defunct.<a name=
"FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70" /><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a> Literally, the <i>one</i> duty of a guru has come to
be to communicate once in a lifetime to each Hindu his saving mantra or
Sanscrit text; periodically thereafter, the guru <!-- Page 165 --><a name=
"Page_165" id="Page_165" />may visit his clients to collect what dues they
may be pleased to give. The place of religious teacher in Hinduism is
vacant, and Christianity and modern thought are taking the vacant place.
The modern middle-class Hindu is in need of a guru. For mere purohits, as
such, he has a small and a declining reverence; but holy men, as such, his
instinct is to honour&mdash;one of the pleasing features of Hinduism. We
can understand it all when we remember how in the Christian Church, in a
crisis like that from which the Church is now emerging, many come to be
married by the clergyman who have practically lapsed from the faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polytheism receding before Monotheism.</div>

<p>In some measure, then, we understand how Hindu polytheism, theism, and
pantheism are related to each other; we realise in some measure the
openness of the Indian mind, and we now ask ourselves how far the
Christian doctrine of God has impressed itself upon that open mind. Of the
polytheistic masses it has already been pointed out that intelligent
individuals will now readily acknowledge that there is truly one God only.
Further, that the polytheistic idolatry which is now associated with the
masses once extended far higher up the scale, is evident to anyone reading
the observations made early in the nineteenth century. Early travellers in
India, like the French traveller Tavernier of the seventeenth century,
<!-- Page 167 --><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" /> speak of the Indians
without distinction as idolaters, contrasting them with the Mahomedans of
India. In the <i>Calcutta Gazette</i> of 1816, Raja Rammohan Roy, the
learned opponent of Hindu idolatry, the Erasmus of the new era, is called
the <i>discoverer</i> of theism in the sacred books of the Hindus.
Rammohan Roy himself disclaimed the title, but writing in 1817, he speaks
of "the system of idolatry into which Hindus are now completely sunk."<a
name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71" /><a href="#Footnote_71_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Many learned brahmans, he says in the same
pamphlet, are perfectly aware of the absurdity of idol worship, indicating
that the knowledge belonged only to the scholars. His own object, he said,
was to declare <i>the unity</i> of God as the real thought of the Hindu
Scriptures. Across India, on the Bombay side, we find clear evidence of
the state of opinion among the middle class in 1830, from the report of a
public debate on the Christian and Hindu religions. The antagonists were,
on the one side, the Scottish missionary Dr. John Wilson and others, and
on the other side two leading officials of the highest Government
Appellate Court, men who would now rank as eminent representatives of the
educated class. <!-- Page 168 --><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />One of
these demanded proof that there was only one God.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"

<div class="sidenote">The beginning of the nineteenth century.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Monotheistic belief a broadening wedge between
pantheism and polytheism.</div>

<p>Returning to Bengal, it would seem from Rammohan Roy's evidence that in
1820 the standpoint of the learned at that time was exactly what we have
called the standpoint of an intelligent individual among the masses
to-day, namely, a plea that the multitude of gods were agents of the one
Supreme God. "Debased and despicable," he writes, "as is the belief of the
Hindus in three hundred and thirty millions of gods, they (the learned)
pretend to reconcile this persuasion with the doctrine of the unity of
God, alleging that the three hundred and thirty millions of gods are
subordinate agents assuming various offices and preserving the harmony of
the universe under one Godhead, as innumerable rays issue from one sun."<a
name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73" /><a href="#Footnote_73_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Turning to testimony of a different kind, we
find Macaulay speaking about the polytheistic idolatry he knew between
1834 and 1838. "The great majority of the population," he writes,
"consists of idolaters." Macaulay's belief was that idolatry would not
survive many years of English education, and we shall now take note how in
the century the sphere <!-- Page 169 --><a name="Page_169" id=
"Page_169" />of idolatry and polytheism has been limited. At the beginning
of the nineteenth century, we may now say that Indian Hindu society
consisted of a vast polytheistic mass with a very thin, an often
invisible, film of pantheists on the top. The nineteenth century of
enlightenment and contact with Christianity has seen the wide acceptance
of the monotheistic conception by the new-educated India. The founding of
the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j or Theistic Association in 1828 by Rammohan Roy
has already been called the commencement of an indigenous theistic church
outside the transplanted theism of Indian Christianity and Indian
Mahomedanism. Strictly rendered, the divine name <i>Brahm&#257;</i>,
adopted by the Br&#257;hmas, expresses the pantheistic idea that God is
the <i>One without a second</i>, not the theistic idea of one personal
God; but what we are concerned with is, that it was in the monotheistic
sense that Rammohan Roy adopted the term. To him Brahm&#257; was a
personal God, with whom men spoke in prayer and praise. As a matter of
fact the pantheistic formula, "One only, no second," occurs in the creeds
of all three new monotheistic bodies, Br&#257;hmas, Pr&#257;rthan&#257;
Sam&#257;jists, and &#256;ryas, but in the same monotheistic sense. The
original Sanscrit of the formula (Ekam eva advityam), three
<!-- Page 170 --><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />words from the
Chh&#257;ndogya Upanishad, is regularly intoned (droned) in the public
worship of Br&#257;hmas. Like a wedge between the polytheism of the masses
below and the pantheism of the brahmanically educated above, there came in
this naturalised theism, a body of opinion ever widening as modern
education enlarges its domain. It is one of the <i>events</i> of Indian
history. Now, pantheistic in argument and polytheistic in domestic
practices as educated Hindus still are, they never call themselves
pantheists, and would resent being called polytheists; they call
themselves theists. "Every intelligent man is now a monotheist," writes
the late Dr. John Murdoch of Madras, an experienced observer.<a name=
"FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74" /><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class=
"fnanchor">[74]</a> "Many" (of the educated Hindus), says a Hindu writer,
"&mdash;I may say most of them&mdash;are in reality monotheists, but
monotheists of a different type from those who belong to the Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j. They are, if we may so call them, passive monotheists.... The
influence of the Hindu environment is as much perceptible in them as that
of the Christian environment."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id=
"FNanchor_75_75" /><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Professor Max M&uuml;ller and Sir M. Monier Williams are of the same
opinion. "The educated classes <!-- Page 171 --><a name="Page_171" id=
"Page_171" />look with contempt upon idolatry.... A complete
disintegration of ancient faiths is in progress in the upper strata of
society. Most of the ablest thinkers become pure Theists or Unitarians."<a
name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76" /><a href="#Footnote_76_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a> That change took place within the nineteenth
century, a testimony to the force of Christian theism in building up
belief, and to the power of the modern Indian atmosphere to dissipate
irrational and unpractical beliefs. For, in contact with the practical
instincts of Europe, the pantheistic denial of one's own
personality&mdash;a disbelief in one's own consciousness, the thought that
there is no thinker&mdash;was bound to give way, as well as the irrational
polytheism. Very unphilosophical may have been Lord Byron's attitude to
the idealism of Berkeley: "When Bishop Berkeley said there was no matter,
'twas no matter what he said." But that represents the modern atmosphere
which New India is breathing, and it is fatal to pantheism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spread of monotheism traced.</div>

<p>It is interesting to note how monotheism spread. The Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j of Madras was founded in 1864, theistic like the mother
society, the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j of Bengal. Three years later the first
of similar bodies on the west side of India was founded, the
Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes or Prayer <!-- Page 172 --><a name=
"Page_172" id="Page_172" />Associations of Bombay. Their very name, the
<i>Prayer</i> Associations, implies the dual conception of God and Man,
for the pantheistic conception does not admit of the idea of prayer any
more than it admits of the other dualistic conceptions of revelation, of
worship, and of sin. These movements, again, were followed in the United
Provinces and the North-West of India by the founding of the <i>&#256;rya
Sam&#257;j</i>, or, as I have called it, the Vedic Theistic Association,
also professedly theistic. Polytheism and pantheism alike, the &#256;ryas
repudiate. For the gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, the founder
of the &#256;ryas declared there was no recognition in the Vedas.
Demonstrable or not, that is the &#256;rya position. The rejection of
pantheism by such a body is noteworthy, for pantheism is identified with
India and the Vedanta, the most widely accepted of the six systems of
Indian philosophy, and the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j is nothing if not
patriotic. It is above all pro-Indian and pro-Vedic. Their direct
repudiation of pantheism may not be apparent to Western minds. &#256;ryas
predicate three eternal entities, God, the Soul, and Matter,<a name=
"FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77" /><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class=
"fnanchor">[77]</a> and this declaration <!-- Page 173 --><a name=
"Page_173" id="Page_173" />of the reality of the soul and of matter is a
direct denial of the pantheistic conception, its very antithesis. One
pantheistic formula is: "Brahma is reality, the world unreality" (Brahma
satyam, jagan mithy&#257;). The Pantheist must declare, and does declare
in his doctrine of Maya or Delusion, that the soul and matter are
illusions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The progress of monotheism seen in the <i>Text-book
of Hindu Religion</i>.</div>

<p>A very striking illustration of the present insufficiency of the
pantheistic conception of God and of the movement of educated India
towards theism is to be found where one would least expect it&mdash;in
connection with the Hindu Revival. In 1903 an <i>Advanced Text-book of
Hindu Religion and Ethics</i> was published by the Board of Trustees of
the Hindu College, Benares, a body representing the movement for a revival
of Hinduism. It was a heroic undertaking to reconcile, in the one
Text-book, Vedic, philosophic, and popular Hinduism, to harmonise all the
six schools of philosophy, to embrace all the aspects of modern Hinduism,
and lastly to satisfy the monotheistic opinions of modern enlightened
Hindus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is Pantheism?</div>

<p>To appreciate the testimony of the Text-book, we must enter more fully
into the orthodox <!-- Page 174 --><a name="Page_174" id=
"Page_174" />Hindu theological position. Pantheism, or the doctrine that
God is all and all is God&mdash;what does it imply? Pantheism is a theory
of creation, that God is all, that there are in truth no creatures, but
only unreal phantasies appearing to darkened human minds, because darkened
and half-blind. As such, its nearest Christian analogue would be the
thought that in every phenomenon we have God's fiat and God's reason, and
that "in Him we live and move and have our being." Pantheism is a theory
of spiritual culture, that our individuality is ours only to merge it in
His, although on this line, the Christian soon parts company with the
Indian pantheistic devotee, who seeks to <i>merge</i> his consciousness in
God, not to train himself into active sonship. Pantheism is a theory of
God's omnipresence, and may be little more than enthusiastic feeling of
God's omnipresence, such as we have in the 139th psalm, "Whither shall I
go from Thy presence? and whither shall I flee from Thy spirit?" That
Oriental mysticism and loyalty to an idea we can allow for. It is in that
aspect that pantheism is in closest contact with the belief of the new
educated Hindu. But in brahmanical philosophy, pantheism is nothing else
than the inability to pass beyond the initial idea of infinite
<!-- Page 175 --><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />preexistent,
unconditioned, Deity. To the pantheist, let us remember, there is Deity,
but there are no real deities; there is a Godhead, but there are no real
persons in the Godhead. In the view of the pantheist, when we see aught
else divine or human than this all-embracing Deity or Godhead, it is only
a self-created mist of the dim human eye, in which there play the
flickering phantasms of deities and human individuals and things. "In the
Absolute, there is no thou, nor I, nor God," said Ramkrishna, a great
Hindu saint who died in 1886.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id=
"FNanchor_78_78" /><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In
Hindu phraseology, every conception other than this all-comprehending
Deity is <i>Maya</i> or delusion, and salvation is "saving knowledge" of
the delusion, and therefore deliverance from it. The perception of <i>
manifoldness</i> is Maya or illusion, says a modern pro-Hindu writer. And
again, "To India, all that exists is but a mighty curtain of appearances,
tremulous now and again with breaths from the unseen that it conceals."<a
name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79" /><a href="#Footnote_79_79"
class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maya is implied in Pantheism.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The outcome of Maya.</div>

<p>The doctrine of Maya is, of course, a postulate, a necessity of
Pantheism. Brahma is the name of the impersonal pantheistic deity. First
<!-- Page 176 --><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" />among the unrealities,
the outcome of Maya or Illusion or Ignorance, is the idea of a supreme <i>
personal</i> God, Parameswar, from whom, or in whom, next come the three
great personal deities, namely, the Hindu Triad, Brahm&#257; (not Brahma),
Vishnu, and Siva,&mdash;Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer respectively.
These and all the other deities are the product of Maya, and thus belong
to the realm of unreality along with Parameswar.<a name="FNanchor_80_80"
id="FNanchor_80_80" /><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Popular theology, on the other hand, begins with the three great personal
deities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hindu Text-book transforms Pantheism into
Monotheism.</div>

<p>Now come we again to the Text-book. Rightly, as scholars would agree,
it describes the predominant philosophy of Hinduism as pantheistic. The
Text-book, however, goes farther, and declares all the six systems of
Hindu philosophy to be parts of one pantheistic system.<a name=
"FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81" /><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class=
"fnanchor">[81]</a> The word pantheism, I ought to say, does not occur in
the Text-book. But here is its teaching. "All six systems," we are told,
"are designed to lead man to the One Science, the One Wisdom which saw One
Self Real and all else as Unreal." And again, "Man learns to climb from
the idea of himself as separate from Brahma to the <!-- Page 177 --><a
name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />thought that he is a part of Brahma that
can unite with Him, and finally [to the thought] that he is and ever has
been Brahma, veiled from himself by Avidy&#257;" (that is, Ignorance or
Maya). Our point is that the <i>Text-book of Hindu Religion</i> is
professedly pantheistic, and the above is clearly pantheism and its
postulate Maya. But in the final exposition of this pantheism, what do we
find? To meet the modern thought of educated India, the pantheism is
virtually given up.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82" /><a href=
"#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Brahma, the One and the All,
becomes simply <i>the Deity Unmanifested</i>; who shone forth to men as
<i>the Deity Manifested</i>, Parameswar; of whom the Hindu Triad,
Brahm&#257; and Vishnu and Siva, are only three <i>names</i>. Maya or
Delusion, the foundation postulate of pantheism, by which things <i>
seem</i> to be,&mdash;by which the One seems to be many,&mdash;is
identified with the creative will of Parameswar. In fact, Pantheism has
been virtually transformed into Theism, Brahma into a Creator, and Maya
into his creative and sustaining fiat. The <i>Text-book of the Hindu
Religion</i> is finally monotheistic, as the times will have it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Parsee claiming to be a monotheist.</div>

<p>As further confirmation of the change in the Indian mind, we may cite
the paper read at the <!-- Page 178 --><a name="Page_178" id=
"Page_178" />Congress on the History of Religions, Basel, 1904, by the
Deputy High-priest of the Parsees, Bombay. The dualism of the Zoroastrian
theology has hitherto been regarded as its distinctive feature, but the
paper sought to show "that the religion of the Parsees was largely
monotheistic, not dualistic."</p>

<p>The theistic standpoint of the younger members of the educated class of
to-day is easily discoverable. The word <i>God</i> used in their English
compositions or speeches, plainly implies a person. The commonplace of the
anxious student is that the pass desired, the failure feared, is dependent
upon the will of God&mdash;language manifestly not pantheistic. Religious
expressions, we may remark, are natural to a Hindu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conception of the Deity as female has gone from
the minds of the educated.</div>

<p>In the new theism of educated Indians we may note that the conception
of the deity as female is practically gone. Not so among the masses,
particularly of the provinces of Bengal and Gujerat, the provinces
distinctively of goddesses. The sight of a man in Calcutta in the first
hour of his sore bereavement calling upon Mother Kali has left a deep
impression upon me.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83" /><a href=
"#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Be it remembered, however,
what his cry meant, and what the name <!-- Page 179 --><a name="Page_179"
id="Page_179" /><i>Mother</i> in such cases means. It is a honorific form
of address, not the symbol for devoted love. The <i>goddesses</i> of
India, not the gods, are the deities to be particularly feared and to be
propitiated with blood. It is energy, often destructive energy, not
woman's tenderness that they represent, even according to Hindu philosophy
and modern rationalisers. We may nevertheless well believe that contact
with Christian ideas will yet soften and sweeten this title of the
goddesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new theism is largely Christian theism&mdash;God
is termed Father;</div>

<div class="sidenote">Or Mother.</div>

<p>The new theism of educated India is more and more emphatically
Christian theism. Anyone may observe that the name, other than "God," by
which the Deity is almost universally named by educated Hindus is "The
Father," or "Our Heavenly Father," or some such name. The new name is not
a rendering of any of the vernacular names in use in modern India; it is
due directly to its use in English literature and in Christian preaching
and teaching. The late Keshub Chunder Sen's <i>Lectures in India</i>,
addressed to Hindu audiences, abound in the use of the name. The
fatherhood of God is in fact one of the articles of the Br&#257;hma creed.
In his last years, the Brahma leader, Keshub Chunder Sen, frequently spoke
of God as the divine <i>Mother</i>, but we are not to <!-- Page 180 --><a
name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />suppose that it expresses a radical change
of thought about God. Keshub Chunder Sen's last recorded prayer begins: "I
have come, O Mother, into thy sanctuary"; his last, almost inarticulate,
cries were: "Father," "Mother." Where modern Indian religious teachers
address God as <i>Mother</i>, it is a modernism, an echo of the thought of
the Fatherhood of God. The name is altered because the name of Mother
better suits the ecstasies of Indian devotion, where the ecstatic mood is
cultivated. A case in point is the Hindu devotee, Ramkrishna Paramhansa,
who died near Calcutta in 1886. "Why," Ramkrishna Paramhansa asks, "does
the God-lover find such pleasure in addressing the Deity as Mother?
Because," his answer is, "the child is more free with its mother, and
consequently she is dearer to the child than anyone else.<a name=

"fnanchor">[84]</a> Another instance we find in the appeal issued by a
committee of Hindu gentlemen for subscriptions towards the rebuilding of
the temple at Kangra, destroyed by the earthquake of 1905. The president
of the committee, signing the appeal, was a Hindu judge of the High Court
at Lahore, a graduate from a Mission College. "There are Hindus," thus
runs the appeal, "who by the grace of the Divine <!-- Page 181 --><a name=

<div class="sidenote">The &#256;rya Sam&#257;j and the name Father.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Hindu College, Benares, and the name <i>
Father</i>.</div>

<p>The &#256;rya Sam&#257;j, on the other hand, seems set against speaking
or thinking of God as the Father. Specially present to their minds and in
their preaching is the thought of God's absolute justice; and they hold
that His Justice and His Fatherhood are contradictory attributes. Virtue
<i>will</i> have its reward, they assert, and Sin its punishment, both in
this and the following existences. We recognise the working of their
doctrine of transmigration, perhaps also the effect of a feeble
presentation of the Christian doctrine of the Father's forgiveness of sin.
Nevertheless, we may note in a hymn-book published in London for the use
of members of the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j resident there, such hymns as "My
God and Father, while I stray," and "My God, my Father, blissful name," as
if the name were not explicitly excluded. We also read that the very last
parting words of the founder of the &#256;ryas himself were: "Let Thy will
be done, O Father!"<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86" /><a href=
"#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The heart of man will not be
denied the name and the feeling of "God who is our home." Turning
<!-- Page 182 --><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />again from the
&#256;ryas to the new citadel of Benares, and Hinduism, the Hindu College,
Benares, we find that along with the Text-book already mentioned, there
was published a <i>Catechism in Hindu Religion and Morals</i> for boys and
girls. One question is, "Can we know that eternal Being (the "One only
without a second," or "The All," <i>i.e.</i> pantheistic Deity)? The
answer is, "Only when revealed as Ishwar, the Lord, the loving Father of
all the worlds and of all the creatures who live in them." That idea of
the loving Father, of divine Law and Love in one person, is new to
Hinduism. The law of God may be only imperfectly apprehended, but the
loving Fatherhood of God, the approachable one, has become manifest in
India&mdash;one of Christianity's dynamic doctrines. Strangest
confirmation of all, a Mahomedan preacher of Behar a few years ago was
expounding from the Koran the Fatherhood of God. The name and thought of
the divine Father established, we may leave name and thought to be
invested with their full significance in the fulness of time.</p>

<p>"It is with Pantheism, not Polytheism, that a rising morality will have
to reckon," says Sir Alfred Lyall.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id=
"FNanchor_87_87" /><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The
result of all our observation <!-- Page 183 --><a name="Page_183" id=
"Page_183" />has been different. Pantheism is melting out of the sky of
the educated, and if nothing else take its place, it will be a selfish
materialism or agnosticism, not avowed or formulated yet shaping every
motive, that the new morality will have to reckon with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pantheism does not lead to belief in "the Son of
God."</div>

<p>Pantheism, it has been said, lends itself to the lead to belief idea of
avatars or incarnations of deity, and Hinduism, therefore, is familiar
with avatars. Observation contradicts this <i>&agrave; priori</i>
reasoning, nay, it justifies a statement almost contrary. To the
philosopher who is thinking out a pantheistic system, or to the ascetic
who is seeking after identity of consciousness with the One, the Hindu
Avatars are only a part of the delusion, the Maya, in which men are
steeped. To a pantheist, holding that his own consciousness of
individuality is delusion, born of spiritual darkness and ignorance, the
conception of an avatar or concrete presentation of deity as an individual
is only still grosser delusion. "The name of God and the conventions of
piety are as unreal as anything else in Maya," writes a
<!-- Page 185 --><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />modern British apostle
of Hinduism, while advocating the realisation of Maya as our salvation.<a
name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88" /><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> It does not seem to me justifiable to say that
through Pantheism the Indian mind can approach the thought of Christ the
Son of Man and the Son of God. But pantheism, with its allied doctrine of
transmigration, may encourage the thought that our Lord was a great jogi
or religious devotee, the last climax of many upward transmigrations, and
that Christ had attained to the goal of illumination of the jogi, namely,
identity of consciousness with deity, when he felt "I and the Father are
one." That statement about Our Lord is sometimes made in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The avatars of popular theology.</div>

<p>It is not through the pantheism of the brahmanically learned and of
religious devotees that the Indian mind has come within Christ's sphere of
influence, but rather through the beliefs of the multitude and the new
education of the middle class. And how, we ask, has Christ been introduced
to India by association with the popular beliefs&mdash;how, rather, has
the attempt been made to do so? The theology of the people begins, as has
been already stated, with the Hindu Triad, the three great personal
deities, namely, Brahm&#257;, Vishnu, and Siva,&mdash;Creator, Preserver,
and Destroyer respectively. <!-- Page 186 --><a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186" />From these and other deities, but particularly from Vishnu,
the Preserver, there descended to earth at various times and in various
forms, human and animal, certain avatars.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id=
"FNanchor_89_89" /><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Best known of these avatars of Vishnu, the Preserver, are Ram, the hero of
the great epic called after him, the R&#257;m&#257;yan; and secondly,
Krishna, one of the chief figures of the other great Indian epic, the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;rat; and thirdly, Buddha, the great religious teacher of
the sixth century B.C. Ram and Krishna have become deities of the
multitude over the greater part of India. Buddha, latest in time of these
three avatars, and unknown as an avatar to the multitude, has not yet been
lost to history. Such is the genealogy of certain of the Hindu gods and
their avatars, and the object of setting it forth is to enable us to see
how Jesus Christ has presented Himself or been presented to the Hindu
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parallels in Christian and Hindu theology.</div>

<p>When Christian doctrine was presented to India in modern times, the
Christian Trinity and the Hindu Triad at once suggested a correspondence,
which seemed to be confirmed by the coincidence of a Creator and Preserver
in the Triad with the Creator and the Son, Our Saviour, in the Trinity.
The historical Christ and the avatars of Vishnu <!-- Page 187 --><a name=
"Page_187" id="Page_187" />would thus present themselves as at least
striking theological and religious parallels. "On the one hand, learned
brahmans have been found quite willing to regard Christ himself as an
incarnation of Vishnu for the benefit of the Western world."<a name=
"FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90" /><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class=
"fnanchor">[90]</a> On the other, Christian missionaries in India have
often preached Christ as the one true avatar.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id=
"FNanchor_91_91" /><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The
idea and the word <i>avatar</i> are always recurring in the hymns sung in
Christian churches in India. Missionaries have also sought to graft the
doctrine of Christ's atonement upon Hinduism, through one of the avatars.
A common name of Vishnu, the second member of the Triad, as also of
Krishna, his avatar, is <i>Hari</i>. Accepting the common etymology of <i>
Hari</i> as meaning <i>the taker away</i>, Christian preachers have found
an idea analogous to that of Christ, the Redeemer of men. Then the
similarity of the names, <i>Christ</i> and <i>Krishna</i>, chief avatar of
Vishnu, could not escape notice, especially since Krishna, Christ-like, is
the object of the enthusiastic devotion of the Hindu multitude. In
familiar speech, Krishna's name is still further approximated to that of
Christ, being frequently pronounced <i>Krishta</i> or <i>Kishta</i>. In
the middle of the nineteenth century the common opinion was that there was
some historical connection between Krishna and Christ, and the idea
lingers in the minds of both Hindus and Christians. One is surprised to
find it in a recent European writer, formerly a member of the Indian Civil
Service. "Surely there is something more," he says, "than an analogy
between Christianity and Krishna worship."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id=
"FNanchor_92_92" /><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Much has been made by the late Dr. K.M. Banerjea, the most learned
member of the Indian Christian Church of the <!-- Page 188 --><a name=
"Page_188" id="Page_188" />nineteenth century, and something also by the
late Sir M. Monier Williams, of a passage in the Rigveda (x. 90), which
seems to point to Christ. The passage speaks of Purusha (the universal
spirit), who is also "Lord of Immortality," and was "born in the
beginning," as having been "sacrificed by the Gods, Sadyas and Rishis,"
and as becoming thereafter the origin of the various castes and of certain
gods and animals. A similar passage in a later book, the <i>T&#257;ndya
Br&#257;hmanas</i>, declares that "the Lord of creatures, Prajapati,
offered himself a sacrifice for the devas" (emancipated mortals or gods).
Of the parallelism between the self-sacrificing Prajapati, Lord of
creatures, and the Second Person in the Christian Trinity,
<!-- Page 189 --><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />propitiator and agent
in creation, we may hear Dr. Banerjea himself: "The self-sacrificing
Prajapati [Lord of creatures] variously described as Purusha, begotten in
the beginning, as Viswakarma, the creator of all, is, in the meaning of
his name and in his offices, identical with Jesus.... Jesus of Nazareth is
the only person who has ever appeared in the world claiming the character
and position of Prajapati, at the same time both mortal and immortal."<a
name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93" /><a href="#Footnote_93_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">These parallels ineffective.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Christ Himself attractive.</div>

<p>But it must be confessed that these parallels, real or supposed,
between Christianity and Hinduism have not brought Christ home to the
heart of India. In themselves, they only bring Christianity as near to
Hinduism as they bring Hinduism to Christianity. Uneducated Hindus feel
that the two religions are balanced when they have Krishna and Christians
have Christ. Educated Hindus, as we shall see, are employing some of these
very parallels to buttress Hinduism. Far be it from me, however, to
depreciate the labours of scholars and earlier missionaries who have thus
established links between Hindus and Christians, and have thus at least
brought Christ into the Hindu's presence. <!-- Page 190 --><a name=
"Page_190" id="Page_190" />To Indian Christians also such reasoning has
often been a strength, furnishing as it were a new justification of their
baptism into Christianity; for looking back they can perceive the finger
of Hinduism itself pointing the way. But had no other influence been
exerted on the Indian mind, one could not say what I now say, that Christ
Himself is the feature of Christianity that has most powerfully moved men
in India. The person of Christ Himself has been the great Christian
dynamic. I am now speaking of educated India, the India that is not
dependent solely upon the preacher for its religious ideas and
feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity identified with Britain and therefore
unpopular.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The anti-foreigner instinct.</div>

<p>The grand new political idea in India is the idea of nationality, and
one of its corollaries is the championing of things Indian and
depreciation of things British. The strong anti-British bias among the
educated is one of the noteworthy and regrettable changes in the Indian
mind within the last half-century. It is not surprising then that all over
India the influence of Christ and of Christianity is lessened from the
identification of Christianity with the British. For a native of India to
accept the British religion is to run counter to the prevailing
anti-British and pro-Indian feeling; it is unpatriotic to become a
<!-- Page 191 --><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" />convert to
Christianity. "Need we go out of India in quest of the true knowledge of
God?" wrote a distinguished Indian litt&eacute;rateur a few years ago.<a
name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94" /><a href="#Footnote_94_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> All that feeling is of course in addition to the
instinctive hostility to things foreign that has been nowhere stronger
than in self-contained India&mdash;self-contained between the Himalayas
and the seas. The exclusiveness of caste is based upon that feeling. The
statement of the late Rev. M.N. Bose, B.A., B.L., a native of Eastern
Bengal, regarding his youth [1860?] is: "I had a deep-rooted prejudice
against Christianity from my boyhood.... At this time I hated Christianity
and Christians, though I knew not why I did so."<a name="FNanchor_95_95"
id="FNanchor_95_95" /><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
We find the instinctive hostility more bluntly expressed in China in the
cry that drops spontaneously from the opening lips of many Chinamen, as
their greeting, when they unexpectedly behold a European. The involuntary
ejaculation is: "Strike the foreign devil."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ reverenced; Christians disliked.</div>

<p>In the first part of the nineteenth century, along with the great
development of modern missions, and of modern education, we may say that
Christ <!-- Page 192 --><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />came again to
India. The national and anti-British feeling had not then arisen to
interpose in His path, but, coming as an alien, His name evoked great
hostility. The popular mood was <i>Christianos ad leones,</i> as many
incidents and witnesses testify. Now, in spite of the old anti-foreign
hostility and the new currents of feeling, a remarkable attitude to
Christianity&mdash;far short of conversion, no doubt&mdash;is almost
everywhere manifest. There is a profound homage to its Founder, coupled
with that strong resentment towards His Indian disciples. Christ Himself
is acknowledged; His church is still foreign and British. Resentfully
ruled by a Christian nation, but subdued by Christ Himself, is the state
of educated India to-day. In spite of His alien birth and in spite of
anti-British bias, Christ has passed within the pale of Indian
recognition. Indian eyes, focused at last, are fastened upon Him, and men
wonder at His gracious words. Again I direct attention to a significant
event in Indian history&mdash;the incoming of an influence that will not
stale, as mere ideas may. "Is there a single soul in this audience," said
the Brahmo leader, the late Keshub Chunder Sen,<a name="FNanchor_96_96"
id="FNanchor_96_96" /><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
to the educated Indians of Calcutta, mostly Hindus, "who would
<!-- Page 193 --><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" />scruple to ascribe
extraordinary greatness and supernatural moral heroism to Jesus Christ and
Him crucified?"</p>

<p>"That incarnation of the Divine Love, the lowly Son of man," writes
another, even while he is rejoicing over the revival of Hinduism.<a name=

<div class="sidenote">Bombay.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Madras.</div>

<p>Interesting phases of that divided mind&mdash;homage to Christ,
resentment towards His disciples&mdash;may be found on opposite sides of
the great continent of India. In Bengal, a not-infrequent standpoint of
Br&#257;hmas in reference to Christ is that <i>they</i> are the true
exponents of Christ's spirit and His teaching. Western Christian teachers,
they say, are hidebound by tradition; and the ready-made rigidity of the
creeds of the Churches is no doubt a factor in the state of mind we are
describing. Looking back as far as to 1820, we see in <i>The Precepts of
Jesus</i>, published by the founder of the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j, that
standpoint of homage to Christ and dissent from accepted views regarding
Him. Illustrative of that Br&#257;hma standpoint, we have also the more
recent book, <i>The Oriental <!-- Page 195 --><a name="Page_195" id=
"Page_195" />Christ</i>, by the late Mr. P.C. Mozumdar, the successor of
Keshub Chunder Sen. But the attitude is by no means limited to Brahmas.
"Without Christian dogmas, cannot a man equally love and revere Christ?"
was a representative question put by a senior Hindu student in Bengal to
his missionary professor. In South India, Mahomedans sometimes actually
describe themselves as better Christians than ourselves, holding as they
do such faith in Jesus and His mother Mary and His Gospel. The case of
Mahomedans is not, of course, on all fours with that of Hindus, since
Mahomedans reckon Christ as one of the four prophets along with their own
Mahomed. In Bombay province, on the other side of India from Bengal, we
find Mr. Malabari, the famous Parsee, pupil of a Mission School, doubting
if it is possible for the Englishman to be a Christian in the sense of <i>
Christ's Christianity</i>, the implication being that an Indian may. What
element of truth is there in the idea, we may well ask? From Indian
Christians, be it said, we may indeed look for a fervency of loyalty to
Christ that does not enter into our calculating moderate souls; and from
India, equally, we may look for that mystically profound commentary on St.
John's Gospel which Bishop Westcott declared he looked for
<!-- Page 196 --><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" /> from Japan. But to
return. About Mr. Malabar! himself, his biographer writes: "If he could
not accept the dogmas of Christianity, he had imbibed its true spirit,"
meaning the spirit of Christ Himself. "The cult of the Asiatic life" is
the latest definition of Christianity given by a recent apologist of
Hinduism, one of a small company of Europeans in India officering the
Hindu revival. Crossing India again and going south, we find the late Dr.
John Murdoch, of Madras, an eminent observer, adding his testimony
regarding the homage paid to the Founder of Christianity. "The most
hopeful sign," he writes, "is the increasing reverence for our Lord,
although His divinity is not yet acknowledged."<a name="FNanchor_98_98"
id="FNanchor_98_98" /><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
And of new India generally, again, we may quote Mr. Bose, the Indian
historian. "The Christianity [of North-western Europe] is no more like
Christianity as preached by Christ than the Buddhism of the Thibetans is
like Buddhism as preached by Gautama." Take finally the following
sentences from a recent number of a moderate neo-Hindu organ, the <i>
Hindustan Review (vol.</i> viii. 514): "Christ, the great exemplar of
practical morality ...; the more <!-- Page 197 --><a name="Page_197" id=
"Page_197" />one enters into the true spirit of Christ, the more will he
reject Christianity as it prevails in the world to-day. The Indians have
been gainers not losers by rejecting Christianity for the sake of
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99" /><a href=

<div class="sidenote">Desire to discover Christian ideas in Hindu
Scriptures.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Christ and Krishna set alongside.</div>

<p>Another phase of that same divided mind, acknowledging Christ and
resenting Indian discipleship, may be perceived in the willingness to
discover Christian ideas in Hindu Scriptures, and Christ-like features in
Hindu deities and religious heroes. To express it from the Indian
standpoint,&mdash;they see Christ and Christianity bringing back much of
their own "refined and modernised." In a sense, as a Bengali Christian
gentleman put it, Christ and Christianity have become the accepted
standards in religion.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id=
"FNanchor_100_100" /><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class=
"fnanchor">[100]</a> Again we quote from the same page of the <i>Hindustan
Review</i>: "A revival of Hinduism has taken place.... It [Christianity]
has given us Christ, and given us noble moral and spiritual lessons, which
we have discovered anew in our own Scriptures, and thereby satisfied our
self-love and made our very own." We have mentioned how missionaries used
to find the doctrine of the atonement in the name of the Indian God Hari;
the argument has now in turn been <!-- Page 198 --><a name="Page_198" id=
"Page_198" />annexed by Hindus, and employed as an argument in their
favour. Within the last twenty years, there has been a great revival of
the honouring of Krishna among the educated classes in Bengal and the
United Provinces. Krishna has set up distinctly as the Indian Christ, or
as the Indian figure to be set up over against Christ. A Krishna story has
been disentangled from the gross mythology, and he has become a paragon of
virtue,&mdash;the work of a distinguished Bengali novelist. I mean no
sarcasm. From the sermon of a Hindu preacher in a garden in Calcutta in
1898, I quote: "The same God came into the world as the Krishna of India
and the Krishna of Jerusalem." These are his words. From the catalogue of
the Neo-Krishnaite literature in Bengal, given by Mr. J.N. Farquhar of the
Y.M.C.A., Calcutta, it appears that since 1884 thirteen Lives of Krishna
or works on Krishna have appeared in Bengal. Many essays have appeared
comparing Krishna with Christ. There have been likewise many editions of
the Bhagabat Gita, or Divine Song, the episode in the Mahabharat, in which
Krishna figures as religious teacher. It may be called the New Testament
of the Neo-Krishnaite. Perhaps the most striking of these Neo-Krishnaite
<!-- Page 199 --><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" />publications is <i>The
Imitation of Sri-Krishna</i>, a daily-text book containing extracts from
the Bhagabat Gita and the Bhagabat Puran. The title is, of course, a
manifest echo of "The Imitation of Christ," which is a favourite with
religious-minded Hindus. The <i>Imitation of Buddha</i>, likewise we may
observe, has been published. About "The Imitation of Christ" itself, we
quote from a Hindu's advertisement appended to the life of a new Hindu
saint, Ramkrishna Paramhansa. "The reader of 'The Imitation of Christ,'"
it says, "will find echoed in it hundreds of sayings of our Lord
Sri-Krishna in the Bhagabat Gita like the following: 'Give up all
religious work and come to me as thy sole refuge, and I will deliver thee
from all manner of sin.'" The notice goes on: "The book has found its way
into the pockets of many orthodox Hindus."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christ and Chaitanya of Bengal.</div>

<p>From Krishna we turn to Chaitanya, surname Gauranga, the fair, a
religious teacher of Bengal in the fifteenth century, who is also being
set up as the Christ of Bengal, in that he preached the equality of men
before God and ecstatic devotion to the god Krishna. A Christ-like man,
indeed, in many ways, Chaitanya was, and the increased acquaintance of
educated Bengal with Jesus Christ naturally brought Chaitanya to the
front. The <!-- Page 200 --><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" />new cult of
Chaitanya and his enthronement over against Jesus Christ are manifest in
the titles of two recent publications in Bengal, the first entitled, <i>
Lord Gauranga, or Salvation for all</i>, and the other, <i>Chaitanya's
Message of Love</i>. Chaitanya and his two chief followers, it should be
said, were called the great <i>lords</i> (prabhus) of the sect, but the
title "Lord Gauranga" is quite new, an echo of the title of Jesus Christ.
With regard to the new power of Christ's personality, it should be noted
that the author of <i>Lord Gauranga</i> strongly deprecates the idea that
his desire is to demolish Christianity, or other than to extend the
kingdom of Jesus Christ. He declares that Jesus Christ is as much a
prophet as any avatar of the Hindus, and that Hindus can and ought to
accept him as they do Krishna or Chaitanya. This is in accord with the
spirit of Hinduism&mdash;namely, the fluidity of doctrine, and the free
choice of guru or religious teacher, as set forth in a previous
chapter&mdash;although it is still an advanced position for a Hindu to
take up publicly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eccentric manifestations of the power of Christ's
personality.</div>

<p>Could we observe the course of evolution down which a species of
animals or plants has come from some remote ancestry to their present
form, with what interest would we note the specific characteristics
gathering strength, as from generation to <!-- Page 201 --><a name=

survive"! The whole onward career of the evolving species would seem to
have been aimed at the latest form in which we find it. Yet quite as
wonderful phenomena as the species that has survived are the many
variations of the species that have presented themselves, but have not
proved fit to survive. One species only survives for hundreds of would-be
collaterals that are extinct. The religious evolution that we have been
observing is the growing power of Christ's personality in New India; and
now, as further testimony to its power, a number of collateral movements,
similarly inspired yet eccentric and hardly likely to endure, attract our
attention. In these eccentric movements the power of Christ's personality
is manifest, and yet it appears amid circumstances so peculiar that the
phenomena in themselves are grotesque.</p>

Christ come again.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hakim Singh.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mirz&#257; Ghol&#257;m Ahmad.</div>

<p>Three of these strange movements let us look at as new evidence of the
power of Christ's personality in India. All three occur in still another
province than those named, the Punjab, a province <i>sui generis</i> in
many ways. Within a generation past, at least two men have arisen, either
claiming to be Christ Himself come again, or a Messiah superior to Him. A
third received a vision of "Jesus God," and<!-- Page 202 --><a name=
"Page_202" id="Page_202" /> proclaimed Him, wherever he went, as an object
of worship. Of the first of the three leaders, Sir Alfred Lyall tells us,
one Hakim Singh, "who listened to missionaries until he not only accepted
the whole Christian dogma, but conceived himself to be the second
embodiment [of Christ], and proclaimed himself as such and summoned the
missionaries to acknowledge him." It sounds much like blasphemy, or mere
lunacy; but in India one learns not to be shocked at what in Europe would
be rankest blasphemy; the intention must decide the innocence or the
offence. Hakim Singh "professed to work miracles, preached pure morality,
but also venerated the cow,"&mdash;strange chequer of Hindu and Christian
ideas.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101" /><a href=
"#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The second case is the
better known one of Mirz&#257; Ghol&#257;m Ahmad, of Q&#257;di&#257;n, who
sets up a claim to be "the Similitude of the Messiah" and "the Messiah of
the Twentieth Century." As his name shows, he is a Mahomedan, but the
assumption of the name "Messiah" also shows that it is in Christ's place
he declares himself to stand. At the same time, his appeal is to his
fellow-Mahomedans; for he explains that as Jesus was the Messiah of Moses,
he himself is the Messiah of Mahomed. His superiority to Christ, he
expressly declares. "<!-- Page 203 --><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" />I
shall be guilty of concealing the truth," he says in his English monthly,
the <i>Review of Religions</i>, of May 1902, "if I do not assert that the
prophecies which God Almighty has granted me are of a far better quality
in clearness, force, and truth than the ambiguous predictions of Jesus....
But notwithstanding all this superiority, I cannot assert Divinity or
Sonship of God." He claims "to have been sent by God to reform the true
religion of God, now corrupted by Jews, Christians, and Mahomedans."
Doubly blasphemous as his claims sound in the ears of orthodox Mahomedans,
who reckon both Christ and Mahomed as prophets, his sect is now estimated
to number at least 10,000, including many educated Mahomedans. Whatever
its fate&mdash;a mere comet or a new planet in the Indian sky&mdash;it
indicates the religious stirring of educated India in another province,
and the prominence of Christ's personality therein. Mirz&#257; Ghol&#257;m
Ahmad himself recommends the reading of the Gospels. As to Christ's death,
Mirz&#257; Ghol&#257;m Ahmad has a theory of his own. The Koran declares,
according to Mahomedan expositors, that it was not Christ who suffered on
the cross, but another in His likeness. Mirz&#257; Ghol&#257;m Ahmad
teaches that Jesus was crucified but did not die, <!-- Page 204 --><a
name="Page_204" id="Page_204" />that He was restored to life by His
disciples and sent out of the country, whence He travelled East until He
reached Thibet, eventually arriving at Cashmere, where He died, His tomb
being located in the city of Srinagar.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id=
"FNanchor_102_102" /><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class=
"fnanchor">[102]</a> According to the latest report of this reincarnation,
he now claims to be at once Krishna come again for Hindus, Mahomed for
Mahomedans, and Christ for Christians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chet Ram claimed to be an apostle.</div>

<p>The third movement is that of the Chet Ramis, or sect of Chet Ram,
whose strange history may be found in <i>East and West</i> for July 1905.
Chet Ram was an illiterate Hindu, a water-carrier and then a steward in
the Indian army that took part in the war with China in 1859-1860.
Returning to his native district not far from Lahore, Chet Ram, the Hindu,
came under the spell of a Mahomedan ascetic Mahbub Sh&#257;h, left all and
followed him as his "familiar" disciple. How this relationship between
Hindu and Mahomedanism is quite possible in India, we have already
explained on pages 163-4; Mahbub Sh&#257;h's strange combination of
religious asceticism with the consumption of opium and wine, it takes some
years' residence in India to understand. Then Mahbub Sh&#257;h died, and
the disciple succeeded the <!-- Page 205 --><a name="Page_205" id=
"Page_205" />master. According to one account, Chet Ram made his bed on
the grave in which his master lay; according to another, for three years
his sleeping place was the vault within which his master was buried. It
was at this time that he had the vision of "Jesus God," already referred
to, between the years 1860 and 1865. Like Caedmon, he has described his
vision in verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 206 --><a name="Page_206" id=
"Page_206" />The Followers of Chet Ram.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Their indefinite composite theology.</div>

<p>Whence came the Christian seed of Chet Ram's vision? His master Mahbub
Shah was a Mahomedan, and Jesus Christ is reckoned one of the Mahomedan
prophets. But it is the Christ of Christianity, not of Mahomedanism, that
Chet Ram saw in his vision of the glorious form showing the face of mercy,
at once the dispenser of justice, the revealer of mysteries, and the giver
of salvation. Whatever the source of the vision, Chet Ram saw and believed
and began to hold up Jesus Christ before other men's eyes, and Chet Ram
himself thus became the guru or religious teacher of what may be called an
indigenous Christian Church. A moderate estimate reckons the Chet Ramis at
about five thousand souls, the religious force of the sect being
represented by the Chet Rami ascetics, who go about making their gospel
known and living on alms. Chet Ram himself died in 1894, and at the
headquarters of the sect at Buchhoke, near Lahore, his ashes and the bones
of his master Mahbub Shah are kept in two coffins, which the faithful
visit, particularly on certain Chet Rami holy-days, on which fairs are
held. In keeping with the command of the vision, several copies of the New
Testament and one complete Bible were also on view when the writer of the
<!-- Page 207 --><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" />article in <i>East and
West</i> visited the sanctuary in 1903. The <i>Census Report</i> for 1901
sums the Chet Ramis up by saying that "the sect professes a worship of
Christ," and that is our present point of view. But we cannot leave them
without noticing also how Indian they are in their unwillingness to define
their thought, and in their readiness to enthrone a holy man and his
relics. Undefined thought we see expressed in symbol. There are <i>
four</i> doors to the sanctuary at Buchhoke,&mdash;the fakiri [Chet Rami
ascetics'] door, the Hindu, Christian, and Mahomedan
doors&mdash;expressing the openness of the Chet Rami sanctuary to all
sects. Their theology is a corresponding conglomeration. It includes a
Christian trinity of Jesus Son of Mary [the Mahomedan designation of
Christ], the Holy Spirit, and God; and a Hindu triad of the world's three
potencies, namely, Allah, Parameswar, and Khuda, a jumble of Hindu and
Mahomedan names, but representing the Hindu triad of the Creator,
Preserver, and Destroyer.</p>

<p>In respect of the phenomenon of the homage shown to Christ over against
the hostility shown to His Church, the second, third, and fourth centuries
in the history of the Church present a striking parallel to the nineteenth
century in India. <!-- Page 208 --><a name="Page_208" id=
"Page_208" />Steadily in these centuries Christianity was progressing in
spite of contempt for its adherents, philosophic repudiation of the
doctrines of the <i>superstitio prava</i>, and official persecution
unknown in British India at least. Then also, as always, Christ stood out
far above His followers, lifted up and drawing all men's eyes. Such in
India also, in the nineteenth century, has been the course of
Christianity; parts of the record of these centuries read like the record
of the religious movements in India in these latter days. Describing the
Neo-Platonists of these centuries, historians tell us that at the end of
the second century A.D. Ammonius of Alexandria, founder of the sect,
"undertook to bring all systems of philosophy and religion into harmony,
by which all philosophers and men of all religions, Christianity included,
might unite and hold fellowship." <i>There</i> are the four doors of the
Chet Rami sanctuary. There also we have the Theosophical Society of India,
professing in its constitution to be "the nucleus of a Universal
Brotherhood of Humanity, representing and excluding no religious creed."
Ammonius, founder of the Neo-Platonists, was a pantheist like the present
leader of the Theosophical Society, Mrs. Besant, and like her
<!-- Page 209 --><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" />too, curiously, had
begun as a Christian.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104" /><a
href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> We recall that of
Indian Theosophy in general, in 1891, the late Sir Monier Williams
declared that it seemed little more than another name for the "Vedanta [or
Pantheistic] philosophy." Exactly like the earlier theosophists also,
Ammonius, the Neo-Platonist, held that the purified soul could perform
physical wonders, by the power of Theurgy. In its constitution the
Theosophical Society professed "to investigate the hidden mysteries of
nature and the psychical powers latent in man." Many can remember how, in
the eighties, Madame Blavatsky took advantage of our curiosity regarding
such with air-borne letters from Mahatmas in Thibet. Again Ammonius, we
read, "turned the whole history of the pagan gods into allegory." There we
have the Neo-Krishnaites of to-day. "He acknowledged that Christ was an
extraordinary man, the friend of God, and an admirable Theurgus." There we
have the stand point of the educated Indians who have come under Christ's
spell. For two centuries the successors of Ammonius followed in these
lines. "Individual Neo-Platonists," Harnack tells us, "<!-- Page 210 --><a
name="Page_210" id="Page_210" />employed Christian sayings as oracles, and
testified very highly of Christ. Porphyry of Syria, chief of the
Neo-Platonists of the third century, wrote a work "against Christians";
but again, according to Harnack, the work is not directed against Christ,
or what Porphyry regarded as the teaching of Christ. It was directed
against the Christians of his day and against the sacred books, which
according to Porphyry were written by impostors and ignorant people. There
we have the double mind of educated India,&mdash;homage to Christ,
opposition to His Church. There also we have the standpoint of Sahib Mirza
Gholam Ahmad of Qadian. Some, we read, being taught by the Neo-Platonists
that there was little difference between the ancient religion, rightly
explained and restored to its purity, and the religion which Christ really
taught, not that corrupted form of it which His disciples professed,
concluded it best for them to remain among those who worshipped the gods.
There is the present Indian willingness to discover Christian and modern
ideas in the Hindu Scriptures, especially in the original Vedas that the
new &#256;rya sect declare to be "the Scripture of true knowledge." The
practical outcome of the Neo-Platonic movement was an attempt
<!-- Page 211 --><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" />to revive the old
Gr&aelig;co-Roman religion,&mdash;Julian the apostate emperor had many
with him. There we have the revival of the worship of Krishna in India,
and the apologies for idolatry and caste. The most recent stage of the
Theosophical Society in India reveals <i>it</i> as virtually a Hindu
revival society. Finally, we read, the old philosopher Pythagoras,
Apollonius of Tyana, and others were represented on the stage dressed in
imitation of Christ Himself, and the Emperor Alexander Severus [A.D.
222-235] placed the figure of Christ in his lararium alongside of those of
Abraham, Orpheus, and Apollonius. There we have the modern Indians who
fully recognise Christ alongside of their own avatars. The whole parallel
is complete.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105" /><a href=
"#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> In spite of the feebleness
and, it may be, unworthiness of His Church, through the force of Christ's
personality, the Roman history of the second, third, and fourth centuries
has been repeating itself in India in the nineteenth and twentieth, and
unless the force of Christ's personality be spent, the parallels will
proceed.</p>

<p>From new reasonings about God, her new monotheism, New India has been
brought a <!-- Page 212 --><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" />stage
farther to actual history. From theologies she has come to the first three
Gospels. New India has been introduced to Christ as He actually lived on
earth before men's eyes; and to India, intensely interested in religious
teachers, the personality of the Christ of the Gospels, of the first three
Gospels in particular, appeals strongly. To the pessimistic mood of India
He appeals as one whose companionship makes this life more worth living;
for Christ was not a jogi in the Indian sense of a renouncer of the world.
His call to fraternal service has taken firm hold of the best Indians of
to-day. Of the future we know not, but we feel that the narrative of the
first three Gospels naturally precedes the deeper insight of the
fourth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian pessimism.</div>

<p>Two commonplaces about India are that pessimism is her natural
temperament, and that a natural outcome of her pessimism is the Indian
doctrine of the transmigration of souls. The second statement will require
explanation; but as regards the former, there is no denying the strain of
melancholy, the note of hopelessness, that pervades these words we have
quoted, or that they are characteristic of India. In them life seems a
burden; to be born into it, a punishment; and of the transmigrations of
our souls from life to life, seemingly, we should gladly see the end. All
the same, as new India is proving, pessimism is not the inherent
temperament of India, and the hope of the end <!-- Page 214 --><a name=
"Page_214" id="Page_214" />of the transmigration, and of the lives of the
soul, no more natural in India than in any other land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Due to nature?</div>

<p>Pessimism is natural in India, say such writers as we have in mind,
because of the spirit-subduing aspects of nature and life amid which
Indians live their lives. Life is of little value to the possessor, they
say, where nature makes it a burden, and where its transitoriness is
constantly being thrust upon us. And that is so in India. Great rivers
keep repeating their contemptuous motto that "men may come and men may
go," and by their floods sometimes devastate whole districts. Sailing up
the Brahmaputra at one place in Assam, the writer saw a not uncommon
occurrence, the great river actually eating off the soft bank in huge
slices, five or six feet in breadth at a time. Something higher up, it
might have been the grounding of a floating tree, had turned the current
towards the bank, and at five-minute intervals, it seemed, these huge
slices were falling in. Not fifty yards back from the <!-- Page 215 --><a
name="Page_215" id="Page_215" />bank stood a cottage, whose garden was
already part gone; a banana tree standing upon one of these slices fell in
and was swept down before our eyes. Within an hour the cottage itself
would meet the same fate, and the people were already rushing in and out.
Or pass to another aspect of nature. For a season every year the unveiled
Indian sun in a sky of polished steel glares with cruel pitiless eye. The
light is fierce. Then, arbitrarily, as it seems, the rains may be
withheld, and the hard-baked, heat-cracked soil never softens to admit the
ploughshare, and hundreds of thousands of the cultivators and field hands
are overtaken by famine. At one time during the famine of 1899-1900, it
will be remembered that six million people were receiving relief. Or,
equally arbitrarily, betokening some unknown displeasure of the gods,
plague may take hold of a district and literally take its tithe of the
population. At any moment, life is liable to be terminated with appalling
suddenness by cholera or the bite of a venomous serpent.</p>

<p>With French imagination and grace, in his <i>Introduction to General
History</i>, Michelet describes the tyranny of nature&mdash;"Natura
maligna"&mdash;in India. "Man is utterly overpowered by nature
there&mdash;like a <!-- Page 216 --><a name="Page_216" id=
"Page_216" />feeble child upon a mother's breast, alternately spoiled and
beaten, and intoxicated rather than nourished by a milk too strong and
stimulating for it."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106" /><a
href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> One cannot help
contrasting the supplicating Indian villagers&mdash;of whom a University
matriculation candidate told in his essay, how, when the rains were
withheld, they carried out the village goddess from her temple and bathed
the idol in the temple tank&mdash;with the English fisher-woman of whom
Tennyson tells us, who shook her fist at the cruel sea that had robbed her
of two sons. As she looked at it one day with its lines of white breakers,
she shook her fist at it and told it her mind&mdash;"How I hates you, with
your cruel teeth."</p>

<p>Can this Indian aspect of nature, one wonders, be the true explanation
of the fierceness of her goddesses as contrasted with her gods, and the
offering of bloody sacrifices to goddesses only? Mother Nature is
malignant, not benign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian life estimated by the economic standard of
life's value.</div>

<p>The value of life and the little worth of life in India may be gauged
in another way. In the language of the political economist, the value of
human life in any country may be estimated by the average wage, which
determines the standard of <!-- Page 217 --><a name="Page_217" id=
"Page_217" />comfort and how far a man is restricted to the bare
necessities of bodily life. Again, judged by that standard, life is
probably in no civilised country at a lower estimate than in India, where
the labourer spends over 90 per. cent of his income upon the bare
necessities for the sustenance of the bodies of his household.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian pessimism only a mood.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Humanlife is rising in value</div>

<div class="sidenote">Pessimism is declining</div>

<p>All that is true, and yet the conclusion is only partly true. In spite
of all such reasoning, and acknowledging that the physical characteristics
of India have largely made her what she is, politically, socially, and
even religiously, I venture to think that the pessimism of India is
exaggerated. Not a pessimistic temperament, but a mood, a mood of helpless
submissiveness, a bowing to the powers that be in nature and in the world,
seems to me the truer description of the prevailing "pessimism." At least,
if it be the case, as I have tried to show, that during the past century
in India, human life has been rising in value, the pessimistic mood must
be declining. Let us observe some facts again. In a Government or Mission
Hospital, <i>there</i> is a European doctor taking part in the offensive
work of the dressing of a coolie's sores,&mdash;we assume that the
doctor's touch is the touch of a true Christian gentleman. To the despised
<!-- Page 218 --><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" />sufferer, life is
gaining a new sweetness, and to the high-caste student looking on and
ready to imitate his teacher, life is attaining a new dignity. That human
life has been rising in value is patent. The wage of the labourer has been
steadily rising&mdash;in one or two places the workers are become masters
of the situation; the rights of woman are being recognised, if only
slowly; the middle classes are eager for education and advancement; the
individual has been gaining in independence as the tyranny of caste and
custom has declined; the sense of personal security and of citizenship and
of nationality has come into being. Whatever the merits of the great
agitation in 1905 against the partition of the Province of Bengal, and
inconceivable as taking place a century ago, it is manifestly the doing of
men keenly interested in the conditions under which they live. It is a
contradiction of the theory of an inherent Indian pessimism. Self-respect
and a sense of the dignity and duties of manhood are surely increasing,
and making our earth a place of hope and making life worth living, instead
of a burden to be borne. "The Hindus," says Sir Alfred Lyall, "have been
rescued by the English out of a chronic state of anarchy, insecurity,
<!-- Page 219 --><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" /> lawlessness, and
precarious exposure to the caprice of despots."<a name="FNanchor_107_107"
id="FNanchor_107_107" /><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Asceticism is declining.</div>

<p>Best proof probably that pessimism is declining is the fact that
asceticism is declining. The times are no longer those in which the life
of a brahman is supposed to culminate in the Sannyasi or ascetic "who has
laid down everything," who, in the words of the Bhagabat Gita, "does not
hate and does not love anything."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id=
"FNanchor_108_108" /><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class=
"fnanchor">[108]</a> The pro-Hindu writer often quoted also acknowledges
the new pleasure in life and the religious corollary of it when she says
that the recent rise in the standard of comfort in India is opposed to the
idea of asceticism. Desire, indeed, is not gone, and the cords of the
heart are not breaking. Says the old brahman, in the guise of whom Sir
Alfred Lyall speaks: "I own that you [Britons] are doing a great deal to
soften and enliven material existence in this melancholy, sunburnt country
of ours, and certainly you are so far successful that you are bringing the
ascetic idea into discouragement and, with the younger folk, into
contempt."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109" /><a href=
"#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Welcome to the new joy
<!-- Page 220 --><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" />of living, all honour
to the old ascetics, and may a still nobler self-sacrifice take their
place!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pessimism, asceticism, transmigration are allied
ideas.</div>

<p>For Western minds it is difficult to realise the close connection
between the doctrine of transmigration and the mood of India, rightly or
wrongly termed pessimism. <i>Our</i> instinctive feeling is that life is
sweet; while there is life there is hope, <i>we</i> say; "<i>healthy</i>
optimism" is the expression of Professor James in his <i>Varieties of
Religious Experience</i>; it is "<i>more life</i> and fuller that we
want." In keeping with this Western and human instinct, the Christian idea
of the Hereafter is a fuller life than the life Here, a perfect eternal
life. To the pessimist, on the contrary [and Hindu philosophy is
pessimistic, whatever be the new mood of India], the question is, "Why was
I born?" The Indian doctrine of transmigration comes with
answer&mdash;"Life is a punishment: it is the bitter consequence of our
past that we are working out; we must <i>submit</i> to be born into the
world again and again, until we are cleared." "Yes, until your minds are
cleared," the Indian pantheist adds, "life <i>itself</i> is a delusion, if
you only knew it; life itself, your consciousness of individuality or
separateness, is a delusion." But the pantheist's thought is here beside
our present point.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 221 --><a name="Page_221" id=
"Page_221" />Transmigration the antithesis of eternal life.</div>

<p>To the pessimistic Indian accepting the Indian view of transmigration,
it is therefore no gospel to preach the continuation of life, either here
or hereafter. "To be born again" sounds like a penance to be endured. <i>
Mukti</i>, commonly rendered <i>salvation</i>, is not regeneration Here
and eternal life Hereafter; it is <i>deliverance</i> from further lives
altogether. If, however, we accept the statement that the value of human
life in India is rising, that life is becoming worth living, and that the
pessimistic mood is no ingrained fundamental trait, we are prepared to
believe that the hopeful Christian conception of the Here and the
Hereafter is finding acceptance. Rightly understood, the Christian
conception is at bottom the antithesis of pessimism and its corollary,
transmigration. To deny the one is almost to assert the other. The decay
of the one is the growth of the other. For the Christian conception of the
Here and the Hereafter&mdash;what is it? Life, eternal, in and through the
Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. "God gave unto us eternal life,
and the life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath the life."<a name=
"FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110" /><a href="#Footnote_110_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Says Harnack in his volume <i>What is
Christianity?</i> "The Christian religion means one thing, and one thing
only&mdash;eternal life <!-- Page 222 --><a name="Page_222" id=
"Page_222" />in the midst of time by the strength and under the eyes of
God." Not that the new idea in India is to be wholly ascribed to Christian
influence. A marked change in Christian thought itself during the
nineteenth century has been the higher value of this present life.
Christianity has become a vitalising gospel for the life Here even more
than for the Hereafter. But assuming the truth of what we have sought to
show, namely, that within the past century the winning personality of
Christ has come to New India, a new incentive to noble life and service,
we have at least a further reason for believing that pessimism and
transmigration are fading out of Indian minds. The new Advent, as that at
Bethlehem, is a turning-point of time; the gloomy winter of pessimism is
turning to a hopeful spring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Over against Transmigration, Christian immortality
is continuity of the individual's memory.</div>

<p>To appreciate the impact of the Christian idea of the Here and
Hereafter upon the Hindu idea of Transmigration and Absorption, the two
ideas must be more fully examined. Stated briefly, the Christian idea is
that after this life on earth comes an Eternity, whose character has been
determined by the life on earth. The crisis of death terminates our bodily
activities and renders impossible any further action, either virtuous or
sinful, and ushers <!-- Page 224 --><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" />the
soul, its ledger closed, its earthy limitations cast off, into some more
immediate presence of God. If in communion with God, through its faith in
Jesus Christ, the soul is in a state of blessedness; if still alien from
God, the soul is in a state of utter misery, for its spiritual perception
and its recollection of itself are now clear. That, at all events, seems a
fair statement of the belief of many Protestants, so far as their belief
is definite at all. But over against transmigration, what are the
essential and distinctive features of that Christian belief? Its
essentially distinctive feature, both in the case of the blessed and of
the miserable, is a <i>continuity</i> of the consciousness in the life
that now is with that which is to come. The soul in bliss or misery is
able to associate its existing state with its past. Even on earth, as the
modern preacher tells us, heaven and hell are already begun. Over against
the Hindu idea of transmigration, accordingly, we define the Christian
idea of immortality as the continuity of our consciousness, or the
immortality of the individual consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmigration is essentially dissolution of the
individual's memory.</div>

<p>Per contra, the distinguishing feature of the Hindu doctrine of
transmigration or rebirth is the interruption of consciousness, the
dissolution of memory, at the close of the present existence. In
<!-- Page 225 --><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" />the next existence
there is no memory of the present.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The draught of Lethe" does
"await</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The slipping through from state to
state."</span><br />


<p>The present life is a member of a series of lives; there are said to be
8,400,000 of them, each member of which is as unconscious of the preceding
as you are of being I. As a seed develops into plant and flower and seed
again, so the soul in each new member of the series develops a conscious
life, lapses from consciousness, and hands on a germinal soul for a new
beginning again. As the seed transmits the type, and also some variation
from the type, so is the germinal soul transmitted through
unconsciousness, ennobled or degraded by each conscious existence it has
lived. At each stage the germinal soul represents the totality, the net
outcome of its existences, as in each generation of a plant the seed may
be said to do. So far, the doctrine of transmigration is a doctrine of the
evolution of a soul, a declaration that in a sense we are all that we have
been, that virtue and vice will have their reward, that in a sense "men
may rise on stepping stones of their dead selves." It does not leave hard
cases of heathen or of reprobates to the discernment and mercy of God; it
<!-- Page 226 --><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" />offers them, instead,
other chances in subsequent lives. A not unattractive doctrine it is, even
although the attractive analogy of the evolution of a plant breaks down.
For in the scientific doctrine of evolution, individuals have no
immortality <i>at all</i>; it is only the species that lives and moves on.
But in Hinduism, as in Christianity, we are thinking of the continuity of
the <i>individual</i> souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The end of transmigration is absorption into
Deity.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The saint Ramkrishna's obliviousness of self.</div>

<p>To proceed with the statement of the doctrine of transmigration. The
climax of the transmigrations is Nirvana or extinction of the individual
soul, according to the Buddhist, and union with or absorption into Deity,
according to the Hindu.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id=
"FNanchor_111_111" /><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class=
"fnanchor">[111]</a> Buddhism has gone from the land of its birth, as
Christianity and even Judaism from Palestine, and I pass from the Buddhist
doctrine. The Hindu climax, of absorption into Deity, is reached when by
self-mastery personal desire is gone, and by profound contemplation upon
Deity a pure-bred soul has lost the consciousness of separation from
Deity. The distinction between <i>I</i> and the great <i>Thou</i> has
vanished; the One is present in the mind not as an objective thought, but
by a transformation of the consciousness itself. The words of
<!-- Page 227 --><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" />Hindus themselves in
the <i>Advanced Text-book of Hindu Religion</i> are: The human soul (the
Jivatmic seed) "grows into self-conscious Deity." Listen also to the words
of Swami Vivekananda, in the Parliament of Religions, Chicago, about his
master, Ramkrishna Paramhansa's growing into self-conscious Deity: "Every
now and then strange fits of God-consciousness came upon him.... He then
spoke of himself as being able to do and know everything.... He would
speak of himself as the same soul that had been born before as Rama, as
Krishna, as Jesus, or as Buddha, born again as Ramkrishna.... He would say
he was ... an incarnation of God Himself." Again Swami Vivekananda tells
us: "From time to time Ramkrishna would entirely lose his own identity, so
much so as to appropriate to himself the offerings brought for the
goddess" (to the temple in which he officiated). "Sometimes forgetting to
adorn the image, he would adorn <i>himself</i> with the flowers."<a name=

<div class="sidenote">Contrasts&mdash;"Born again" and a spiritual
aristocracy of long spiritual descent.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Heaven and Hell not necessary ideas in
Transmigration.</div>

<p>Radical differences from Christian thought <!-- Page 228 --><a name=
"Page_228" id="Page_228" />emerge. In the Hindu conception, the acme is
reached only by a spiritual aristocracy of long spiritual descent; for the
common multitude there is no gospel of being born again in Christ, no
guiding hand like that of Our Lord towards the Father's presence. The
upward path, according to the Hindu idea, is the path of philosophical
knowledge and of meditation, not the power of union with Jesus Christ to
make us sons of God. Most striking difference perhaps of all&mdash;in the
Hindu philosophical system there is no place for even the conceptions of
heaven and hell except as temporary halting-places between two
incarnations of the soul, which practical necessity requires. For the
soul, this world is the plane of existence; union with omnipresent Deity
is the climax of existence that the Hindu devotee seeks to attain; yet not
in a Hereafter, but as he sits on the ground no longer conscious of his
self. "The beatific vision of Hinduism," says a recent pro-Hindu writer,
"is to be relegated to no distant future."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id=
"FNanchor_113_113" /><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class=

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 229 --><a name="Page_229" id=
"Page_229" />Several heavens and hells in popular Hinduism.</div>

<p>Hindus are divided as to the existence of these temporary
halting-places between the successive incarnations of the soul. The <i>
Text-book of Hindu Religion</i>, already referred to, speaks
unhesitatingly about their place in the Hindu system. The &#256;ryas, on
the other hand, hold that the instant a soul leaves its body it enters
another body just born. The soul is never naked&mdash;to employ a common
figure. Of course in popular Hinduism it is not surprising to find not
merely the ideas of Heaven and Hell, but even that each chief Deity has
his own heaven and that there are various hells. In the Tantras or ritual
books of modern Hinduism, there is frequent mention of such heavens and
hells, and when the idea of rebirths is also met with, the rebirths are
regarded as stages towards the reward or punishment of the <i>individual
conscious</i> souls. It is the popular idea of heaven that has given rise
to the common euphemism for <i>to die</i>, namely, to become a deva or
inhabitant of heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmigration, associated with pessimism and
pantheism, is likewise yielding.</div>

<p>We have observed the pessimistic mood of India yielding before the
improved conditions of life, and the brahmanical pantheism before the
thought of God the Father. Bound up as the idea of transmigration has been
with the pessimism and pantheism of India, we are prepared to find that
<!-- Page 230 --><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" />it too is yielding. Of
that we now ask what evidence there is in the ordinary speech and writings
of educated India, apart from controversy or professedly Hindu writings,
in which the accepted Indian orthodoxy would probably appear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Educated Hindus speak of the dead as if their former
consciousness continued.</div>

<p>From the ordinary speeches and writings of educated Hindus regarding
the dead, no one would infer that their doctrinal standpoint was other
than that of the ordinary religious Briton, namely, that the dead friend
has returned to God or has been called away by God, or the like. A native
judge in Bengal, one of the most distinguished leaders of the Hindu
Revival, writes as follows: The beatitude which the new Radha-Krishnaites
aspire to "is not the Nirvana of the Vedantists, the quiescence of
Rationalism. Nirvana and quiescence are merely negatives. The beatitude
[of the new Radha-Krishnaites] is a positive something. They do not aspire
to unification with the divine essence. They prefer hell with its torments
to such unification."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115" /><a
href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> A few years ago, at a
public meeting in Calcutta, the acknowledged leader of Hinduism, speaking
of a Hindu gentleman whose death we were lamenting, said: "God has taken
him to himself"&mdash;certainly not a Hindu statement<!-- Page 231 --><a
name="Page_231" id="Page_231" /> of the passing of a soul. Similarly, in
1882 we find one nobleman in Bengal writing to another regarding his
mother's death: "It is my prayer to God that she may abide in eternal
happiness in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116" /><a
href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Generations of Hindu
students I have known to find pleasure in identifying themselves with
Wordsworth's views of immortality:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Trailing clouds of glory do we
come</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From God who is our home,"</span><br />


<p>and</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The faith that looks through

<div class="sidenote">Transmigration now no more than a conventional
explanation of how misfortunes befell one.</div>

<p>Somewhat dreamlike Wordsworth's views may be, but his belief is clearly
not in transmigration. To the educated Hindu, who may not consciously have
rejected the idea of transmigration, the doctrine is really now no more
than a current and convenient explanation of any misfortune that has
befallen a person. "Why has it befallen him? He must have earned it in
some previous existence. It is in the debit balance of the transactions in
his lives." Such are the vague ideas floating in the air. Upon any
individual's acts or plans for the future, the idea of transmigration
seems to have no bearing whatever beyond a numbing of the will.<a name=
"FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117" /><a href="#Footnote_117_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> <!-- Page 232 --><a name="Page_232" id=
"Page_232" />For in theory, the Hindu's fate is just. In strict logic no
doubt the same numbing effect might be alleged about the Christian
doctrine of predestination. Even when misfortune has overtaken an educated
Hindu, I think I am justified in saying that the more frequent thought
with him is now in keeping with the new theistic belief; the misfortune is
referred to the will of God. As already said, it is a commonplace of the
unfortunate student who has failed, to ascribe his failure to God's
will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmigration and Predestination more properly
contrasted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration from actual fact.</div>

<p>There is room for the Christian thought of the Hereafter, because in
reality, as theologians know, the doctrine of transmigration stands over
against the Christian doctrine of predestination rather than over against
the Christian doctrine of the Here and Hereafter. Transmigration is a
doctrine of what has gone before the present life rather than of what will
follow. Every educated Anglo-Indian whom I have consulted agrees that in a
modern Hindu's mouth transmigration is only a theory of the incidence of
actual suffering. Here is the doctrine of <i>karma</i> (works), that is of
transmigration or merited rebirth, in the actual life of
India&mdash;transmigration and the pessimistic helplessness of which I
have spoken? In the last great famine of 1899-1900, in a village in
South-western India, a <!-- Page 233 --><a name="Page_233" id=
"Page_233" />missionary found a victim of famine lying on one side of the
village street, and not far off, upon the other side, two or three men of
the middle class. The missionary reproached them for their callousness.
What might be answered for them is not here to the point; their answer for
themselves was, "It is his <i>karma</i>." The missionary did what he could
for the famine sufferer, and then when repassing the group could not
forbear remarking to them, "You see you were wrong about his <i>
karma</i>." "Yes, we were wrong," they replied. "It was his <i>karma</i>
to be helped by you." The same views of karma and of transmigration, as
referring to the past, not the future, are apparent in a recent number of
<i>The Inquirer</i>, a paper conducted in Calcutta for the benefit of
Hindu students and others. I take the following from the question column:
"Do Christians believe in the doctrine of reincarnation? If not, how do
you account for blindness at birth?" The questioner's idea is plain, and
the coincidence with the question put to Christ in St. John's Gospel,
chapter ix, is striking. Hindus thus have room for an idea of the <i>
future</i> of the soul, as Christians, on their side, have for a theory of
the soul's origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of the Hereafter not dynamical with
Christians at present.</div>

<p>The Christian idea of the Hereafter cannot, as <!-- Page 234 --><a
name="Page_234" id="Page_234" />yet, be called a strongly dynamical
doctrine of Christianity in the sense that the Person of Our Lord has
proved dynamical. Not that interest in the subject is lacking. I have
referred to questions put by educated Hindus in <i>The Inquirer</i>. Out
of fifty-seven questions I find eight bearing on the Christian doctrine of
the Hereafter or the Hindu doctrine of Transmigration. In the <i>Magazine
of the Hindu College</i>, <i>Benares</i>, out of fourteen questions I find
four bearing on the same subject. The want of force in the Christian
doctrine no doubt reflects its want of force for Christians themselves in
this present positive age. For even Tennyson himself was vague:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"That which drew from out the boundless

Transmigration.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Text-book of Hindu Religion</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A European's place on the ladder of
transmigration.</div>

<p>Of the sects of recent origin, only the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j or
Theistic Association rejects the doctrine of transmigration avowedly. We
have already said that the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j or Vedic Theists of the
United Provinces and the Punjab hold strongly to the doctrine. It is
noteworthy that <i>they</i> should do so, the Vedas being their standards
wherewith to test Modern Hinduism, for the doctrine of transmigration is
scarcely hinted at in the Vedas, and in the oldest, the Rigveda, there is
said to be no trace of <!-- Page 235 --><a name="Page_235" id=
"Page_235" />the doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id=
"FNanchor_118_118" /><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a> It appears in the later writings, the Upanishads, and
is manifest throughout the Code of Manu (c. A.D. 200). Mrs. Besant, chief
figure among the Indian Theosophists, now virtually a Hindu Revival
Association, preaches the doctrine, and, in fact, lectured on it in
Britain in 1904. At the same time, transmigration is no part of the
Theosophist's creed. As might be expected, the <i>Text-book of Hindu
Religion</i>, of the Hindu College, Benares, gives the doctrine of
transmigration a prominent place, although the explicitness with which it
is set forth is very surprising to one acquainted with the way the
doctrine is generally ignored by the educated. I quote from the <i>Hindu
Text-book</i>, published in 1903, that Westerns may realise that in
dealing with transmigration we are not dealing simply with some old-world
doctrine deciphered from some palm-leaf written in some ancient character.
After describing&mdash;here following the ancient philosophical writings,
the Upanishads&mdash;how the Jivatma or Soul comes up through the various
existences of the mineral, plant, and animal kingdoms until it reaches the
human stage, the Text-book proceeds to describe the further upward or
downward process. It is declared that the<!-- Page 236 --><a name=
"Page_236" id="Page_236" /> downward movement (from man to animal) is now
much rarer than formerly&mdash;that concession is made to modern
ideas&mdash;but the <i>law</i> of the downward process is as follows:
"When a man has so degraded himself below the human level that many of his
qualities can only express themselves through the form of a lower
creature, he cannot, when his time for rebirth comes, pass into a human
form. He is delayed, therefore, and is attached to the body of one of the
lower creatures as a co-tenant with the animal, vegetable, or mineral Jiva
[life], until he has worn out the bonds of these non-human qualities and
is fit to take birth again in the world of men. A very strong and
excessive attachment to an animal may have similar results." Where modern
ideas reach in India, one can understand such ideas as those melting away.
A second passage from the Text-book is interesting, as showing the
compiler's idea of the place of a life in Europe in the chain of
existences, although in this case also the statement is made only about
"ancient days." "The Jivatma [soul] was prepared for entrance into each
[Indian] caste through a long preliminary stage <i>outside</i> India; then
he was born into India and passed into each caste to receive its definite
lessons; then was born away from India to practise these lessons; usually
<!-- Page 237 --><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" />returning to India to
the highest of them, in the final stages of his evolution." In other
words, people of the outer world, say Europeans, are rewarded for virtue
by being born into the lowest Indian caste, and then, after rising to be
brahmans in India, they go back to Europe to give it the benefit of their
acquirements; and finally crown their career by reappearing in India as a
brahman philosopher or jogi. Surely we may laugh at this without being
thought unsympathetic or narrow-minded. We recall Mrs. Besant's assertion
that she had a dim recollection of an existence as a brahman pandit in
India. According to the spiritual genealogy of the <i>Hindu Text-book</i>,
she may hope to be born next in an Indian child, and become a jogi
possessed of saving knowledge of the identity of self with Deity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The women of the middle class and
transmigration.</div>

<p>I asked a lady who had been a missionary in Calcutta for many years,
how far a belief in transmigration was apparent among the women of the
middle class. She could recall only two instances in which it had come to
her notice in her talks with the wives and daughters of educated India.
Once a reason was given for being kind to a cat, that the speaker's
grandmother might then be in it as her abode, although the observation was
<!-- Page 238 --><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" />accompanied with a
laugh. On the second occasion, when the lady was having trouble with a
slow pupil, one of the women present, sympathising with the teacher, said,
"Do not trouble with her; perhaps next time when she comes back she will
be cleverer." The general conclusion, therefore, I repeat: Transmigration
is no longer a living part of the belief of educated India; the Christian
conception of the Hereafter is as yet only partially taking its place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recapitulation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The new Theism.</div>

<p>In the new India, as fish out of the water die, many things cannot
survive. We have seen the educated Hindu dropping polytheism, forgetting
pantheism, and adopting or readopting monotheism as the basis of his
religious thinking and feeling. For modern enlightenment and Indian
polytheism are incongruous; there is a like incongruity between Indian
pantheism and the modern demand for practical reality. Likewise, both
polytheism and pantheism are inconsistent with Christian thought, which is
no minor factor in the education of modern India. Further, the theism that
the educated Hindu is adopting as the basis of his religion approaches to
Christian Theism. The doctrines of the Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of Man have become commonplaces in his mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 240 --><a name="Page_240" id=
"Page_240" />Homage to Christ Himself</div>

<p>Likewise, the educated Hindu is strongly attracted to the person of
Jesus Christ, in spite of His alien birth and His association with Great
Britain. There is a sweet savour in His presence, and the man of any
spirituality finds it grateful to sit at His feet. That familiar oriental
expression, hyperbolical to our ears, but ever upon the lips in India to
express the relationship of student to trusted professor, or of disciple
to religious teacher, expresses exactly the relationship to Jesus Christ
of the educated man who is possessed of any religious instinct. To such a
man the miracles, the superhuman claims, the highest titles of Jesus
Christ, present no difficulty until they are formulated for his
subscription in some hard dogmatic mould. Then he must question and
discuss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transmigration forgotten.</div>

<p>Again, the educated Hindu finds himself employing about the dead and
the hereafter not the language of transmigration, but words that convey
the idea of a continuation of our present consciousness in the presence of
a personal God. For life is becoming worth living, and the thought of life
continuing and progressing is acceptable. This present life also has
become a reality; a devotee renouncing the world may<!-- Page 241 --><a
name="Page_241" id="Page_241" /> deny its reality; but how in this
practical modern world can a man retain the doctrine of Maya or Delusion.
It has dropped from the speech and apparently out of the mind of the
educated classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideas of Sin and Salvation by faith in Jesus
Christ not yet dynamical.</div>

<p>I have suggested that those features of Christianity that are proving
to be dynamical in India will be found to be those same that are proving
to be dynamical in Britain. The converse also probably holds true, as our
religious teachers might do well to note. The doctrines of Sin and
Salvation through faith in Jesus Christ do not yet seem to have commended
themselves in any measure in India. Positive repudiation of a Christian
doctrine is rare, but the flourishing new sect of the North-West, the
&#256;ryas, make a point of repudiating the Christian doctrine of
salvation by faith, although not explicitly denying it in their creed.
Over against it they set up the Justice of God and the certainty of
goodness and wickedness receiving each its meed. One can imagine that
salvation by faith in Jesus Christ, the outstanding feature of
Christianity, may have been unworthily presented to the &#256;rya leaders,
so that it appeared to them merely as some cheap or gratis kind of
"indulgences." The biographer of the Parsee<!-- Page 242 --><a name=
"Page_242" id="Page_242" /> philanthropist, Malabari, a forceful and
otherwise well-informed writer, sets forth that idea of salvation by
faith, or an idea closely akin. He is explaining why his religious-minded
hero did not accept the religion of his missionary teachers. "The proud
Asiatic," he says, "strives to purchase salvation with work, and never
stoops to accept it as alms, as it necessarily would be if faith were to
be his only merit." The unworthy presentation of "salvation by faith" may
have occurred either in feeble Christian preaching or in anti-Christian
pamphlets. Neither is unknown in India; and anti-Christian pamphlets have
been known to be circulated through &#256;rya agencies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideas of sin incompatible with pantheism.</div>

<p>To appreciate the attitude of the Hindu mind to the doctrines of Sin
and Salvation, we must return again to the rough division of Hindus
into&mdash;first, the mass of the people, polytheists; secondly, the
educated classes, now largely monotheists; thirdly, the brahmanically
educated and the ascetics, pantheists. It is only with the monotheists
that we have now to deal. As already said&mdash;to the pantheist the word
sin has no meaning. Where all is God, sin or alienation from God is a
contradiction in terms. The conception of sin implies the <i>two</i>
conceptions of God and Man, or at least <!-- Page 243 --><a name=
"Page_243" id="Page_243" />of Law and Man; and where one or other of these
two conceptions is lacking, the conception of sin cannot arise. In
pantheism, the idea of man as a distinct individual is relegated to the
region of Maya or Delusion; there cannot therefore be a real sinner. Does
such reasoning appear mere dialectics without practical application, or is
it unfair, think you, thus to bind a person down to the logical deductions
from his creed? On the contrary, persons denying that we can sin are easy
to find. Writes the latest British apostle of Hinduism, for the leaders of
reaction in India are a few English and Americans: "There is no longer a
vague horrible something called sin: This has given place to a clearly
defined state of ignorance or blindness of the will."<a name=
"FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119" /><a href="#Footnote_119_119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a> I quote again also from Swami Vivekananda,
representative of Hinduism in the Parliament of Religions at Chicago in
1893. It is from his lecture published in 1896, entitled <i>The Real and
the Apparent Man</i>. His statement is unambiguous. "It is the greatest of
all lies," he says, "that we are mere men; we are the God of the
Universe.... The worst lie that you ever told yourself is that you were
born a sinner.... The wicked see this universe as a <!-- Page 244 --><a
name="Page_244" id="Page_244" />hell; and the partially good see it as
heaven; and the perfect beings realise it as God Himself. By mistake we
think that we are impure, that we are limited, that we are separate. The
real man is the One Unit Existence." Such is the logical and the actual
outcome of pantheism in regard to the idea of sin, and such is the
standpoint of Hindu philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sankarachargya, the pantheist's, confession of
sins.</div>

<p>Or if further illustration be needed of the incompatibility of the
ideas of pantheism and sin, listen to the striking prayer of
Sankarachargya, the pantheistic Vedantist of the eighth century A.D., with
whom is identified the pantheistic motto, "One only, without a second."<a
name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120" /><a href=
"#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> It attracts our attention
because Sankarachargya is professedly confessing sins. Thus runs the
prayer: "O Lord, pardon my three sins: I have in contemplation clothed in
form thee who art formless; I have in praise described thee who art
ineffable; and in visiting shrines I have ignored thine omnipresence."<a
name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121" /><a href=
"#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Beautiful expressions
indeed, confessions that finite language and definite acts are inadequate
to the Infinite, nay, contradictions of the Infinite, expressions fit to
be recited in prayer <!-- Page 245 --><a name="Page_245" id=
"Page_245" />by any man of any creed who feels that God is a Spirit and
omnipresent! But in a Christian prayer such expressions would only form a
preface to confession of one's own <i>moral</i> sin; after adoration comes
confession. Whether, like Sankarachargya, we think of the Deity
objectively, as the formless and literally omnipresent Being, the <i>pure
Being</i> which, according to Hegel, equals nothing, or whether like Swami
Vivekananda we think of man and God as really one, all differentiation
being a delusion within the mind&mdash;there is <i>no second</i>, neither
any second to sin against nor any second to commit the sin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The masses and the sense of sin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Prescriptions for sinners.</div>

<p>For the ignorant masses, the sense of sin has been worn out by the
importance attached to religious and social externals and by the
artificial value of the service of a hereditary monopolist priesthood.
These right, all is right in the eyes of the millions of India. When one
of the multitude proposes to himself a visit to some shrine or sacred
spot, no doubt the motive often is some divine dissatisfaction with
himself; it is a feeling that God is not near enough where he himself
lives. But what is poured into his ears? By a visit to Dwaraka, the city
of Krishna's sports, he will be liberated from all his sins. By bathing in
<!-- Page 246 --><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" />the sacred stream of
the Ganges he will wash away his sins. All who die at Benares are sure to
go to heaven. By repeating the Gayatri (a certain verse of the Rigveda
addressed to the sun) a man is saved. "A brahman who holds the Veda in his
memory is not culpable though he should destroy the three worlds"&mdash;so
says the Code of Manu. The Tantras, or ritual works of modern Hinduism,
abound in such prescriptions for sinners. "He who liberates a bull at the
Aswamedika place of pilgrimage obtains <i>mukti</i>, that is salvation or
an end of his rebirths." "All sin is destroyed by the repetition of Kali's
thousand names." "The water of a guru's [religious teacher's] feet
purifies from all sin." "The man who carries the guru's dust [the dust of
the guru's feet] upon his head is emancipated from all sin and is [the
god] Siva himself." "By a certain inhalation of the breath through the
left nostril, and holding of the breath, with repetition of <i>yam</i>,
the V&#257;yu Bija or mystical spell of wind or air, the body and its
indwelling sinful self are dessicated, the breath being expelled by the
right nostril."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122" /><a href=
"#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And so on <i>ad
infinitum</i>. Superstition, Western <!-- Page 247 --><a name="Page_247"
id="Page_247" />or Eastern, has no end of panaceas. We recall the
advertisements of "Plenaria indulgenzia" on the doors of churches in South
Italy. Visiting Benares, the metropolis of popular Hinduism, the
conception of salvation everywhere obtruded upon one is that it is a
question of sacred spots, and of due offerings and performances
thereat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The signification of sacrifices to the Indian
masses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Description of animal sacrifice.</div>

<p>What to the masses is <i>sacrifice</i> even, the word which to western
ears, familiar with the term in our Scriptures, suggests acknowledgment of
sin and atonement therefor? It is a mistake to regard sacrifices in India
as expiatory; they are gifts to the Deities as superior powers for boons
desired or received, or they are the customary homage to the powers that
be, at festivals and special occasions. Animal sacrifices are
distinguished from the offerings of fruits and flowers only in being
limited to particular Deities and pertaining to more special occasions. An
actual instance will show the place that sacrifices hold. In a letter from
a village youth to his father, informing him how he had proceeded upon his
arrival at Calcutta, whither he had gone for the University Matriculation
Examination, he reports that he has offered a goat in sacrifice in order
to ensure his success. What he probably does is this. In a bazaar near the
great <!-- Page 248 --><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" />temple of
Kalighat, near Calcutta, the greatest centre of animal sacrifices in the
world, he buys a goat or kid, fetches it into the temple court and hands
it over to one of the priests whom he has fee'd. The priest puts a
consecrating daub of red lead upon the animal's head, utters over it some
mantra or sacred Sanscrit text, sprinkles water and a few flowers upon it
at the actual place of slaughter, and then delivers it over again to the
offerer. Then when the turn of the offerer, whom we are watching, has
come, he hands over the animal to the executioner, who fixes its neck
within a forked or Y-shaped stick fixed fast in the ground. With one blow
the animal's head is severed from its body. The bleeding head is carried
off into the shrine to be laid before the image of the goddess, and become
the temple perquisite. The decapitated body is carried off by the offerer
to furnish his family with a holiday meal. With his forehead ceremonially
marked with a touch of the blood lying thick upon the ground, the offerer
leaves the temple, his sacrifice finished. Such is animal sacrifice; if
the description recalls the slaughter-house, the actual sight is certainly
sickening. Yet, far as a European now feels from worship in such a place,
and thankful to Him who has abolished <!-- Page 249 --><a name="Page_249"
id="Page_249" />sacrifice once for all, there is no doubt religious
gratification to those who go through what I have described. Our point is
that, as Sir M. Monier Williams declares, in such an offering, "there is
no idea of effacing guilt or making a vicarious offering for sin."<a name=
"FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123" /><a href="#Footnote_123_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The educated classes and the idea of sin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The brahma monopoly of nearness to the Deity broken
down.</div>

<p>The educated classes, breathing now a monotheistic atmosphere, although
in close contact with polytheism in their homes and with pantheism in
their sacred literature, have reached the platform on which the idea of
sin may be experienced. A member of that class, a pantheist no longer, is
in the presence of a personal God, a Moral Being, and is himself a
responsible person, with the instincts of a child of that Supreme Moral
Being, our Father. With his education, he knows himself to be independent
of brahmanical mediation in his intercourse with that Being. As
confirmation, it is noteworthy how many of the religious leaders of modern
times, like Buddha of old, are other than brahman by caste. In a previous
chapter the names of a number of these non-brahman leaders were given.
Even the Hindu ascetics of these latter days are more numerously
non-brahman than of old, for in theory only brahmans have reached the
<!-- Page 250 --><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" />ascetical stage of
religious development. Whatever the reason, the brahmanical monopoly of
access to and inspiration from the Deity is no longer recognised by
new-educated India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The worship of the new sects&mdash;its
significance.</div>

<p>In like manner, the new religious associations seem to feel themselves
directly in the presence of God. Congregational worship, a feature new to
Hindus, is a regular exercise in the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j or Theistic
Association of Bengal, the Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes or Prayer
Associations of Western India, and the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j or Vedic
Theistic Association of the United Provinces and the North-West of India.
When Rammohan Roy, the theistic reformer, opened his church in Calcutta in
1830, he introduced among Hindus congregational worship and united prayer,
before unknown among them and confessedly borrowed from Christian
worship.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124" /><a href=
"#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The public worship in all
these bodies is indeed not unlike many a Christian service, consisting of
Prayer to God, Praise of God, and expositions of religious truth. In a
small collection of hymns, "Theistic Hymns," published some years ago for
the use of members of the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j, we find many Christian
hymns expressive of this personal relationship to God. We find "My God, my
Father, while I <!-- Page 251 --><a name="Page_251" id=
"Page_251" />stray," and "O God, our help in ages past." Neither of these
hymns, however, it must be noted, contains confession of sin. Curiously
incongruous to our minds is the inclusion among these hymns of poems like
"The boy stood on the burning deck," and "Tell me not in mournful
numbers," and "There's a magical tie to the land of our home," etc.<a
name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125" /><a href=
"#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Even among the Hindu
revivalists, judged by that test of the incoming of public worship, we
perceive the growth of the idea of personal relationship to God. A recent
publication of that party is "<i>Songs for the worship of the Goddess
Durga</i>." One of them, we may note in passing, is the well-known hymn,
"Work, for the night is coming." All such personal relationship, we again
repeat, is incompatible with pantheism, and almost equally so with the
popular sacerdotalism. Not without significance do the new theists of
Western India call their associations the Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes
or Prayer Associations, and give to the buildings in which they worship
the name of Prayer Halls instead of temples. Let not men say that religion
and theological belief belong to separable spheres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of sin naturally accompanies the new
monotheism.</div>

<p>Once more, the public worship and prayer <!-- Page 252 --><a name=
"Page_252" id="Page_252" />attendant on the new monotheism of the new
religious associations are the signs that the stage has been reached where
sin will be felt and confessed. As yet, however, it cannot be said that
the thought of sin is prominent. In the creeds of the &#256;rya Sam&#257;j
and the Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;jes, the word <i>sin</i> does not
occur. What we find in the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j is as follows. From the
creed of the Southern India Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j, of date about 1883, we
quote paragraph 7: "Should I through folly commit sin, I will endeavour to
be atoned <i>[sic]</i> unto God by earnest repentance and reformation."<a
name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126" /><a href=
"#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> From the "Principles of the
Sadharan [Universal or Catholic] Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j," set forth in the
organ of the body, we quote a paragraph 8: "God rewards virtue and
punishes sin, but that punishment is for our good and cannot last to
eternity." From a publication by a third section of the Br&#257;hma
Sam&#257;j, the party of Keshub Chunder Sen, we quote: "Every sinner must
suffer the consequences of his own sins, sooner or later, in this world or
in the next; for the moral law is unchangeable and God's justice
irreversible. His mercy also must have its way. As the just king, He
visits the soul with <i>adequate agonies</i>, and <!-- Page 253 --><a
name="Page_253" id="Page_253" />when the sinner after being thus chastised
mournfully prays, He as the merciful Father delivers and accepts him and
becomes reconciled to him. Such reconciliation is the only true
atonement."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127" /><a href=
"#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Even in the last quoted,
the expression "adequate agonies" shows its standpoint regarding salvation
from sin to be salvation by repentance, and not the standpoint of St.
Paul, "I live, and yet no longer I, but Christ liveth in me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hinduism superseded Buddhism because it offered
salvation, not extinction.</div>

<p>Salvation does mean something to every class. The huge fabric of
Brahmanism does not continue to exist without ministering to some
wide-felt need of the masses. It was in obedience to some inward demand,
however perverted, that children were cast into the Ganges at Saugor, that
human sacrifices were offered and self-tortures like hook-swinging were
endured. These have been put down by British authority, but there still
remain many austerities and bloody sacrifices and strange devices to
satisfy the clamant demand of our souls. Even may we not say that, along
with other reasons for the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some
<!-- Page 255 --><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" />response more
satisfying to the human need must have been offered by the rival system of
Hinduism. Hinduism has deities and avatars; Buddhism had none. Two of the
most interesting spots in India, the most sacred in the world to
Buddhists, are Budh-gaya, where under the bo tree Buddha attained to
enlightenment, and S&#257;rn&#257;th, where he began his preaching. Yet
the worship at neither place to-day is Buddhist. At the scene of Gautama's
enlightenment, where he became Buddha or Enlightened, one of the
conventional statues of Buddha is actually marked and worshipped as
Vishnu, the Hindu deity, the Preserver in the Hindu triad. Even at that
most holy shrine of Buddhism, Hinduism has supplanted it, for popular
Hinduism offered salvation, while Buddhism offered extinction. Turning
from the masses to the philosophical ascetic&mdash;when he cuts himself
off from family life with all its variety of pleasure and interest, not to
speak of the self-torture he also sometimes inflicts, he too has some
corresponding demand, some adequate motive to satisfy. His is the resolute
quest for salvation of the higher, older type. But we are dealing with
modern, new-educated India, and now we ask ourselves: What does the
modern, new-educated Indian mean by<!-- Page 256 --><a name="Page_256" id=
"Page_256" /> salvation? Why does the thought of salvation by faith in
Jesus Christ fail to reach his heart?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Three ways of salvation in Hinduism: more strictly,
three stages.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1. Saving knowledge</div>

<div class="sidenote">Or now Beatific Vision.</div>

<p>The acute Indian mind, with its disposition to analyse and its
tenderness towards all manifestations of religion, has noted three
different paths of salvation, or more strictly three stages in the path.
The last only really leads to salvation, the other two paths are tolerant
recognition of the well-meaning religious efforts of those who have not
attained to understanding of the true and final path of salvation. For
convenience sake we may roughly designate the three ways as Saving Works,
and Saving Faith, and Saving Knowledge, placing the elementary stage
first. One of the Tantras or ritual scriptures of Modern Hinduism, the
Mahanirv&#257;na Tantra, thus explains the three stages in the path and
their respective merits: "The knowledge that Brahma alone is true is the
best expedient; meditation is the middling [= the means?]; and (2) the
chanting of glories and the recitation of names is the worst; and (3) the
worship of idols is the worst of the worst.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id=
"FNanchor_128_128" /><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class=
"fnanchor">[128]</a> Of the pantheist's "saving knowledge," perhaps enough
has been said. But again, it is the piercing of the<!-- Page 257 --><a
name="Page_257" id="Page_257" /> veil of Maya or Delusion which hides from
the soul that God is the One and the All. It is the transformation of the
consciousness of "I" into that of the "One only, without a second." It is
the ability to say "Aham Brahman," <i>i.e.</i> I am Brahma. In the <i>Life
of Dr. Wilson</i>, the Scottish Missionary at Bombay, we read that in
1833, Dr. Wilson went with a visitor to see a celebrated jogi who was
lying in the sun in the street, the nails of whose hands were grown into
his cheek, and on whose head there was the nest of a bird. The visitor
questioned the jogi, "How can one obtain the knowledge of God?" and the
reply of the jogi was, "Do not ask me questions; you may look at me, for I
am God." "Aham Brahman," very probably was his reply. That is pantheistic
salvation, <i>mukti</i>, or deliverance from further human existences and
their desires and delusions. At last the spirit is free, and the galling
chains of the lusting and limited body are broken. But as pantheism is
declining, such cases are growing fewer, and for the educated Hindus, now
largely monotheists, the saving knowledge is rather a beatific vision of
the Divine, only vouchsafed to minds intensely concentrated upon the quest
and thought of God, and cut off from mundane <!-- Page 258 --><a name=
"Page_258" id="Page_258" />distractions. This is the union with God which
is salvation to many of the modern monotheistic Hindus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The quest of the beatific vision still implies the
dissociation of religion and active life.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An unproductive religious ideal.</div>

<p>What concerns us here is that in the conception of the beatific vision,
we still find ourselves in a different religious world from
ours&mdash;religion exoteric for the vulgar, and religion esoteric for the
enlightened; religion not for living by, but for a period of retirement; a
religion of spiritual self-culture, not of active sonship and brotherhood.
Far be it from me to say that at this point the West may not learn as well
as teach, for how much thought does the culture of the spirit receive
among us? How little! However that may be, this conception of the
religious life is deeply rooted in educated India. The impersonal
pantheistic conception of the Deity may be passing into the theistic, and
even into Christian theism; the doctrine of transmigration may be little
more than the current orthodox explanation of the coming of misfortune;
the doctrine of Maya or the illusory character of the phenomena of our
consciousness, it may be impossible to utter in this new practical age;
and Jesus Christ may be the object of the highest reverence; but still the
instinctive thought of the educated Hindu is that there is a period of
<!-- Page 259 --><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" /> life for the world's
work, and a later period for devotion to religion. When dissatisfaction
with himself or with the world does overtake him, instinctively there
occur to him thoughts of retirement from the world and concentration of
his mind, thereby to reach God's presence. Very few spiritually minded
Hindus past middle life pass into the Christian Church, as some do at the
earlier stages of life. Under the sway of the Hindu idea of salvation, by
knowledge or by intense intuition, they withdraw from active life to
meditate on God, with less or more of the practice of religious exercises.
Painful to contemplate the spiritual loss to the community of a conception
of religion that diverts the spiritual energy away from the community, and
renders it practically unproductive, except as an example. Once more we
recall as typical the jogi, not going about doing good, anointed with the
Holy Ghost and with power, but fixed like a plant to its own spot, and
with inward-looking eyes. Time was that there were jogis and joginis
(female jogis) in Europe; but even of St. Theresa, at one period of her
life a typical jogini, we read that not long after her visions and
supernatural visitations, she became a most energetic reformer of the
convents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 260 --><a name="Page_260" id=
"Page_260" />The jogi, not the brahman, is the living part of present-day
Hinduism.</div>

<p>That quest for the beatific vision or for union with God, is the
highest and the most living part of present-day Hinduism, whether
monotheistic or pantheistic. Not the purohit brahman (the domestic
celebrant), or the guru brahman (the professional spiritual director),
conventionally spoken of as divine, but the jogi or religious seeker is
the object of universal reverence. And rightly so. The reality of this
aspect of Hinduism is manifest in the ease with which it overrides the
idea of caste. In theory brahmans are the twice-born caste, the nearest to
the Deity and to union with Him. A man of lower caste, in his upward
transmigrations towards union with God or absorption into Deity, should
pass through an existence as a brahman. In the chapter on Transmigration
we found that the upward steps of the ladder up to the brahman caste had
been clearly stated in an authoritative Hindu text-book. The word <i>
br&#257;hman</i>, the name of the highest caste, is itself in fact a
synonym for Deity. But as a matter of fact, men of any caste, moved by the
spirit, are found devoting themselves to the jogi life. "He who attains to
God is the true br&#257;hman," is the current maxim, attributed to the
great Buddha.</p>

<p>This brings us to the second of the three paths of salvation, the
middle portion of the upward path to the mountain top of clear, unclouded
vision of the All, the One Soul. In Hindu theory, at this second stage man
is still amid the clouds that cling to the mountain's breast. For easy
reference I have named it <i>Salvation by Faith</i>, although the English
term must not mislead. The extract from the Mahanirv&#257;na Tantra,
already quoted, describes this inferior stage as the method of "chanting
of glories and recitation of names" of gods. The Sanscrit name, <i>
Bhakti</i>, is rendered devotion, or fervour, or faith, or fervent love;
and in spite of alien ideas associated with bhakti, bhakti is much more
akin to Faith than are many of the features of Hinduism to the Christian
analogues with whose names they are ticketed. For example, bhakti
practically implies a personal god, not the impersonal pantheistic Brahma.
Intense devotion to some personal god, generally Vishnu the preserver,
under the name Hari, or either of Vishnu's chief incarnations, Ram or
Krishna, is the usual manifestation of bhakti. In actual practice it
displays itself in ecstatic dancing or singing, or in exclaiming the name
of the god or goddess, or in self-lacerations <!-- Page 262 --><a name=
"Page_262" id="Page_262" />in his or her honour. Lacerations and what we
would call penances, be it remembered, are done to the honour of a Deity;
they are not a discipline like the self-whipping of the Flagellants and
the jumping of the Jumpers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
"Bhakti," says Sir Monier Williams, "is really a kind of 'meritorious
work,' and not equivalent to 'faith' in the Christian sense."<a name=
"FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129" /><a href="#Footnote_129_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Bhakti is the religion of many millions of
India, combined more or less with the conventional externals of sacrifice
and offerings and pilgrimages and employment of brahmans, which together
constitute the third path of salvation, by karma or works. That ecstatic
adoration is religion for many millions of India, although the name <i>
bhakti</i> may never pass their lips. We judged the idea of salvation by
knowledge, or by intense concentration of mind, to be <i>genuinely</i>
felt, because it could override the idea of caste. Applying the same test
here, we must acknowledge the genuineness of feeling in bhakti.
Theoretically, at least, as Sir Monier Williams says, "devotion to Vishnu
supersedes all distinctions of caste"; and again, "Vishnavism [Vishnuism],
notwithstanding the gross polytheistic superstitions and hideous idolatry
<!-- Page 263 --><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" />to which it gives
rise, is the only Hindu system worthy of being called a religion."<a name=
"FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130" /><a href="#Footnote_130_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In actual practice the repudiation of caste no
doubt varies greatly. In some cases, caste is dropped only during the fit
of fervour or bhakti. At Puri, <i>during</i> the celebrated Juggernath
(Jagan-nath, Lord of the world) pilgrimage, high caste and low together
receive and eat the temple food, afterwards resuming their several ranks
in caste. As a matter of fact it was found at the census of 1901, that
with the exception of a few communities of devotees, all the professed
Vishnuites returned themselves by their caste names. Hindu bhakti, like
Christianity, is in conflict with caste, and bhakti has not proved fit to
cope with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bhakti in other religions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">In Christian worship.</div>

<p>Bhakti, then, is simply the designation for fervour in worship or in
presence of the Deity, as it appears in Hinduism. For fervour is not
peculiar to any religion, even ecstatic fervour. We see it among the Jews
in King David's dancing before the ark of the Lord, and we see it in the
whirling of the dervishes of Cairo, despite Mahomedans' overawing idea of
God. May we not say that the singing in Christian worship recognises the
same religious <!-- Page 264 --><a name="Page_264" id=
"Page_264" />instinct, and the necessity to permit the exercise of it.
Many of the psalms, we feel we must chant or sing; reading is too cold for
them&mdash;the 148th Psalm for example, "Praise ye the Lord from the
heavens; praise Him in the heights: praise ye Him, sun and moon," and so
on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bhakti a natural channel for religious feeling, now
being reconsecrated.</div>

<p>We pass over the extravagances and gross depths to which bhakti,
devotion or faith or love, may degenerate in the excitement of religious
festivals&mdash;<i>corruptio optimi pessimum</i>. Even, strange to say, we
find the grossness of bhakti also deliberately embodied in figures of wood
and stone. Passing that over, we repeat that in bhakti or devotion to a
personal God, or even only ecstatic extravagant devotion to a saint or
religious hero semi-deified, we have a natural channel for the religious
feeling of Indians, a channel that in these days is wearing deep. I speak
of the middle classes, not of the ignorant masses, and my point is that
the middle classes and the new religious organisations including the
Indian Church are reconsecrating bhakti. Here is a portion of a bhakti
hymn of one of the sections of the Br&#257;hma Sam&#257;j:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The gods dance, chanting the name of
Hari;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dances my Gouranga in the midst of the
choral band;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eyes full of tears, Oh! how
beautiful!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jesus dances, Paul dances, dances Sakya
Muni."</span><br />


<div class="sidenote"><!-- Page 265 --><a name="Page_265" id=
"Page_265" />Bhakti in the Indian Church.</div>

<p>Between singing the song and acting it while singing, the distance in
India is little. The explanation of a recent Hindu devotee, Ramkrishna
Paramhansa, is: "A true devotee, who has drunk deep of divine Love, is
like a veritable drunkard, and as such cannot always observe the rules of
propriety."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131" /><a href=
"#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Manifestations of bhakti we
would soon have in the Indian Christian Church were the cold moderating
influence of Westerns lessened; and as the Church increases and becomes
indigenous, we must welcome bhakti in measure. Every religious procession
will lead to manifestations of bhakti. In the Church of Scotland Magazine,
<i>Life and Work</i>, for November 1904, we are told of a convert at
Calcutta: "She kept speaking and singing of Jesus.... She appeared to the
Hindu family to be a Christ-intoxicated woman." Again, in the <i>Indian
Standard</i> for October 1905, we read of a religious revival among the
Christians of the hills in Assam, where the Welsh missionaries work. We
may contrast the concomitants of the revival with those attending the late
revival even among the fervid Welsh. At one meeting, we are told, "the
fervour rose at times to boiling heat, and scores of men were almost
beside themselves<!-- Page 266 --><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" /> with
spiritual ecstasy. We never witnessed such scenes; scores of people
literally danced, while large numbers who did not dance waved their arms
in the air, keeping time, as they sang some of our magnificent Khassie
hymns."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saving knowledge naturally superseded by Bhakti in
the new monotheism.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An object of bhakti needed for educated India.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Buddha, Krishna, Chaitanya.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Jesus Christ, the supereminent object of
bhakti.</div>

<p>If what I have frequently repeated in these chapters be
correct&mdash;that in the nineteenth century educated India has become
largely monotheistic, it is in keeping therewith that the prevailing
conception of religion should have changed, alongside, from the quest of
Saving Knowledge to that of Bhakti or enthusiastic devotion to a person.
Direct confirmation of that inference, a recent Hindu historian supplies.
In a different context altogether, he declares: "The doctrine of bhakti
(Faith) now rules the Hindu to the almost utter exclusion of the higher
and more intellectual doctrine of gnan (Knowledge of the Supreme Soul)."
The conception of the all-comprehending impersonal Brahma has, indeed,
lost vitality; for the educated also the externals of the popular religion
have lost their significance and become puerile. But for them also, the
objects of popular bhakti, Ram and Krishna, are as much epical as
religious heroes. Hinduism needs an object of bhakti for her educated
people. The fact explains <!-- Page 267 --><a name="Page_267" id=
"Page_267" />several of the novel religious features of the past
half-century. The great jogi, Buddha, although not a brahman, was
rediscovered as a religious hero for Hindus; at the commencement of the
century he was a heretic to the brahmans. "The head of a sect inimical to
Hinduism," the great Rammohan Roy calls him. So Sir Edwin Arnold's <i>
Light of Asia</i> had a great vogue some twenty years ago. Then Krishna
has had his life re-written and his cult revived&mdash;purged of the old
excesses of the Krishna-bhakti. More recently, Chaitanya, the religious
teacher in Bengal in the fifteenth century, has been adopted by certain of
the educated class in Bengal as an object of bhakti. Here, it seems to me,
is found the place of Christ in the mind of educated India. They are
fairly familiar now with the story of the New Testament, and Jesus Christ
stands before them as the supereminent object of bhakti; and I venture to
say is generally regarded as such, although comparatively few as yet have
adopted the bhakti attitude towards Him. The <i>Imitatio Christi</i>,
however, is a well-known book to the spiritually minded among the educated
classes. India has advanced beyond the cold, intellectual, Unitarian
appreciation of Jesus Christ that marked the early Br&#257;hma and
Pr&#257;rthan&#257; Sam&#257;j movements <!-- Page 268 --><a name=
"Page_268" id="Page_268" />and manifested itself in their creeds in
express denial of any incarnation. For Br&#257;hma worship, I have seen
the hymn, "Jesus, lover of my soul," transformed into "Father, lover of my
soul." Hindus of the newer bhakti attitude to Christ would find no
difficulty in singing the hymn as Christians do, provided the doctrinal
background be not obtruded upon them. Sober faith has dawned, and will
formulate itself by and by.</p>

<p>Sailing, say to India, from Britain down through the Atlantic, close by
the coast of Portugal and Spain, and then, within the Mediterranean,
skirting the coast of Algeria, and so on, one is often oppressed with a
sense of his isolation. We can see that the land we are passing is
inhabited by human beings like ourselves; and those houses visible are
homes; and signs of life we can see even from our passing vessel. What of
all the tragedies and comedies that are daily being enacted in these
houses&mdash;the exits and the entrances, the friendships and the feuds,
the selfishnesses and self-sacrifices, the commonplace toil, the
children's play, that are going <!-- Page 270 --><a name="Page_270" id=
"Page_270" />on the very moment we are looking? We are out of it, and our
affections refuse to be wholly alienated from these fellow-beings,
although the ship of which we form a part must pursue her own aim, and
hurries along.</p>

<p>The Briton's tie to India and Indians is of no passing accidental
character. Our life-histories are not merely running parallel; our
destinies are linked together. Christian feeling, duty, self-interest, and
the interest of a linked destiny all call upon us to know each other and
cherish mutual sympathy. Not that the West has ever been without an
interest in India, as far back as we have Indian history, in the Greek
accounts of the invasion of India by Alexander the Great in 327 B.C.
Writing in the first century B.C. and rehearsing what the earlier Greek
writers had said about India, Strabo, the Greek geographer, testifies to
the prevailing interest in India, and even sets forth the difficulty of
knowing India, exactly as a modern student of India often feels inclined
to do. "We must take with discrimination," he says, "what we are told
about India, for it is the most distant of lands, and few of our nation
have seen it. Those, moreover, who have seen it, have seen only
<!-- Page 271 --><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" /> a part, and most of
what they say is no more than hearsay. Even what they saw, they became
acquainted with only while passing through the country with an army, in
great haste. Yea, even their reports about the same things are not the
same, although they write as if they had examined the things with the
greatest care and attention. Some of the writers were fellow-soldiers and
fellow-travellers, yet oft-times they contradict each other.... Nor do
those who at present make voyages thither afford any precise information."
We sympathise with Strabo, as our own readers also may. The interest of
the West was of course interrupted when the Turks thrust themselves in
between Europe and India and blocked the road Eastward overland. But the
sea-road round the Cape of Good Hope was discovered, and West and East met
more directly again, and Britain's special interest in India began. Judged
by the recent output of English books on India, the interest of Britons in
things Indian is rapidly increasing, and, <i>pace</i> Strabo, it is hoped
that this book, the record of the birth of New Ideas in India, will not
only increase the knowledge but also deepen interest and sympathy. For
even more noteworthy than the number of new books&mdash;since many of the
new <!-- Page 272 --><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" />books deal only
with what may be called Pictorial India&mdash;is the deepening of interest
manifest in recent years.</p>

<p>That self-glorifying expression, "the brightest jewel in the British
crown," has grown obsolete, and India has become not the glory of Britain,
but the first of her imperial responsibilities. The thought of Britain as
well as the thought of new India has changed. To the extent of recognising
a great imperial responsibility, the mission efforts of the Churches and
the speeches of statesmen and the output of the press have converted
Britain. India, what her people actually are in thought and feeling, what
the country is in respect of the necessities of life and industrial
possibilities&mdash;these are questions that never fail to interest an
intelligent British audience. In this volume, the aim has been to set
forth the existing thoughts and feelings, especially of new-educated
India, and to do so on the historical principle, that to know how a thing
<i>has come to be</i>, is the right way to know what it is and how to
treat it. The history of an opinion is its true exposition. These chapters
are not speculations, but a setting forth of the progress of opinion in
India during the British period, and <!-- Page 273 --><a name="Page_273"
id="Page_273" />particularly during the nineteenth century. The successive
chapters make clear how wonderful has been the progress of India during
the century in social, political, and religious ideas. The darkness of the
night has been forgotten, and will hardly be believed by the new Indians
of to-day; and ordinary Britons can hardly be expected to know Indian
history beyond outstanding political events. Not, however, to boast of
progress, but to encourage educated Indians to further progress, and to
enlighten Britons regarding the India which they are creating, is the hope
of this volume. Further progress has yet to be made, and difficult
problems yet await solution, and to know the history of the perplexing
situation will surely be most helpful as a guide. What future is in store
for India lies hidden. It would be interesting to speculate, and with a
few <i>ifs</i> interposed, it might be easy to dogmatise. What will she
become? is indeed a question of fascinating interest, when we ask it of a
child of the household, or when we ask it of a great people rejuvenated,
to whom the British nation stands in place of parent. In the history of
the soul of a people, the century just ended may be but a brief space on
which to stand to take stock of what is past and seek inspiration for the
<!-- Page 274 --><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" />future, to talk of
progress made and progress possible.</p>

and we are bound to reflect well upon it in our outlook ahead.</p>

originally a geographical term referring to the country of the River
Indus. It is derived from the Sanscrit (<i>Sindhu</i>), meaning <i>
river</i>, from which also come <i>Indus, Sindh, Hindu, Hindi,</i> and <i>
India</i>. The names <i>Indus</i> and <i>India</i> are English words got
from Greek; they are not Indian, terms at all, although they are coming
into use among educated Indians.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
